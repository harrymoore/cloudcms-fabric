You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing.

                        "html": "<p>You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started</h2>\n\n<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>\n\n<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Item number one</li>\n<li>Item number two\n<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>\n<li>A final item</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or with numbers!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>\n<li>Drink the milk  </li>\n<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"links\">Links</h3>\n\n<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whataboutimages\">What about Images?</h3>\n\n<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png\" alt=\"The Ghost Logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quoting\">Quoting</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said.

Sew a basting stitch along the long sides of the panel and treat it as one piece. Assemble the layers of the two Zipper Panels, two Side Panels, and Zipper Pocket in the same way.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Assemble the Layers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/03-DSC_9276_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nQuilt one Side Panel and the Zipper Pocket panel as desired. I chose to stitch a 1-inch grid. You can use a fabric marker and a ruler to draw out the stitch lines or just “eyeball” it like I did using the markings on my sewing machine as a guide. Leave the 2nd Side Panel piece un-quilted and sew a basting stitch around the edges. Mark the center points on the top, bottom, and sides of each piece using a fabric marker.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Quilt the Layers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/02-DSC_9272_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Step 2: Make the Zipper Pocket\nPlace a zipper along the top edge of the Zipper Pocket with the teeth front facing the exterior side. Position the zipper stop ½'' away from the right side. Let the edge of the zipper tape hang over the edge of the pocket piece a little bit. Using a zipper foot on your sewing machine, sew along the zipper tape about 1/4 inch away from the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Add the Zipper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/04-DSC_9284_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nFold the Zipper Pocket away from the zipper, flip the pocket over so you can see the zipper tape. Topstitch about 1/8’’ away from the edge of the zipper tape, enclosing the raw edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew on the Zipper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/1-DSC_9291_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake the Pocket Trim piece and fold the sides toward the center with wrong sides together. Leave a small gap between the raw edges and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pocket Trim](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/07-DSC_9304_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nLay one edge of the Pocket Trim along the upper zipper tape with the right side of the fabric facing the zipper front. Let the zipper tape extend slightly over the trim.

Topstitch 1/8'' away from the seam, making sure you sew through the trim on the back as well\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Place the Zipper Pocket Peice](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/09-DSC_9318_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nPlace the Zipper Pocket piece on top of the non-quilted Side Panel. Pin in place and Topstitch along the top edge of the Zipper Pocket Trim.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pin in Place](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/11-DSC_9339_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nBaste the sides and bottom of the Zipper Pocket to the Side Panel. Be careful as you sew over the zipper teeth. Use the hand wheel to walk the machine through the zipper teeth to avoid breaking the needle. Slide the zipper slider toward the center and trim the excess zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Make Interior Pocket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/16-DSC_9370_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3: Make the Interior Pocket\nFold the interior pocket piece along the fold line and press. Sew along the folded edge 1/8'' away from the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pocket Lining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/1-DSC_9387_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nPlace the pocket on the lining of the quilted Side Panel. Baste the sides and bottom in place. Sew a divider line in the center. I put a pin at the top of the pocket, flipped it over and stitched the divider line along the center quilting line. Remember to backstitch at the top of the pocket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Making Lining Pockets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/23-DSC_9407_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Step 4: Make the Zipper Panel\nCenter the remaining zipper along the edge of a Zipper Panel with teeth facing the exterior side. Let the edge of the zipper tape hang over the edge of the panel piece slightly. Using a zipper foot, sew along the zipper tape about 1/4 inch away from the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Make Zipper Panel](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/12-DSC_9346_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nFold the Zipper Panel away from the zipper. From the zipper tape side topstitch about 1/8’’ from the edge of the zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Make another Zipper Panel](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/13-DSC_9349_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat for the other side of the zipper and the remaining Zipper Panel piece and trim excess zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Finished Zipper Panel](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/14-DSC_9359_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace one end of the Zipper Panel piece on top of one end of the Bottom panel piece with exterior sides together. Cut a 5 inch piece of Bias Tape. Open the folds and pin it to one side of the lining. Stitch with a 1/8’’ seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attach the Bias Tape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/18-DSC_9374_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRefold the bias tape to enclose the raw edges. Stitch along the bias tape about ¼ ’’ away from the edge. Repeat for the other end of the Zipper Panel and Bottom Panel making a loop. Press the seams away from the zipper panel.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew on the Bias Tape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/19-DSC_9379_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLay the loop flat and center the zipper panel. Mark the center and side points with a marking pen or pins. Make sure to leave the zipper about halfway open.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Finished Zipper Panel](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/20-DSC_9384_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5: Make the Handle\nFold the Handle piece in half lengthwise and press with wrong sides together to mark the center.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Handle Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/24-DSC_9413_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOpen the fold and press the raw edges toward the center but leave about a 1/4'' gap in the center. Lift one side and slide in the remaining small strip of interfacing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fold the Handle Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/25-DSC_9417_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRefold all folds and press. Topstitch along each side 1/8’’ from each edge and in the center, as desired.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew the Handle](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/27-DSC_9425_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace the handle about ¼’’ below the zipper panel on the side closest to the zipper pull. Baste in place. And pin or clip down so it stays out of the way during final construction.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attach the Handle](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/02-DSC_9097_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6: Sew the Bag Together\nBaste the Bias Tape to the edges of the zipper panel. Open the folds of the tape fold the end toward the inside about ½ ‘’. Finger press and line up the edge of the tape with the edge of the zipper panel with the right side of the Bias Tape facing the lining. Sew with a basting stitch about 1/8’’ from the edge. When you reach the beginning, overlap the bias tape by about 1’’ and trim.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baste the Bias Tape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/PicMonkey%20Collage_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat for the other side. It should look something like this.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Repeat the Other Side](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/05-DSC_9120_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin or clip a side panel to the zipper panel with exterior sides together. Start by matching top, bottom, and side seam centers and place a clip at each point. Then clip the corners. Make sure the top of the zipper panel is next to the opening of the pockets so they are right side up. Sew around the sides using a seam allowance. Check that the bias tape is laying flat and out of the way as you sew. Keep the needle in the down position each time you stop to re-position the bag. Don’t worry if the stitch line is a little wobbly, just make sure you’ve caught all the layers in the stitches.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Clip it Together](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/06small-DSC_9121_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRefold the Bias Tape to enclose the seam and topstitch through the layers about ¼ ‘’ away from the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew the Bias Tape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/09-DSC_9153_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn bag Right side out and push out the corners. Work the seams open and pinch the seams together to press the sides if necessary.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![All Done!](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/17-DSC_9253_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n**Now, wrap it up and give it to your dear old dad!**",

Sew a basting stitch along the long sides of the panel and treat it as one piece. Assemble the layers of the two Zipper Panels, two Side Panels, and Zipper Pocket in the same way.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/03-DSC_9276_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Assemble the Layers\" />\n</p> \n\n<p>Quilt one Side Panel and the Zipper Pocket panel as desired. I chose to stitch a 1-inch grid. You can use a fabric marker and a ruler to draw out the stitch lines or just “eyeball” it like I did using the markings on my sewing machine as a guide. Leave the 2nd Side Panel piece un-quilted and sew a basting stitch around the edges. Mark the center points on the top, bottom, and sides of each piece using a fabric marker.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/02-DSC_9272_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Quilt the Layers\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"step2makethezipperpocket\">Step 2: Make the Zipper Pocket</h4>\n\n<p>Place a zipper along the top edge of the Zipper Pocket with the teeth front facing the exterior side. Position the zipper stop ½'' away from the right side. Let the edge of the zipper tape hang over the edge of the pocket piece a little bit. Using a zipper foot on your sewing machine, sew along the zipper tape about 1/4 inch away from the edge.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/04-DSC_9284_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Add the Zipper\" />\n</p> \n\n<p>Fold the Zipper Pocket away from the zipper, flip the pocket over so you can see the zipper tape.

You'll be making a grid of paper that is 7 across and 4 down. The states will overlap just a bit, trim off the white portion along the edges and tape the map together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Print Your Map](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%206_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Step 2\nCut apart the states. I cut down the center of the thick black line, but you can do it any way you'd like. Begin cutting out your states. To do this, I recommend cutting a piece of fusible webbing a little larger than the state you're cutting out. Cut out a fabric piece as well. Fuse the webbing to the back of the fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut out the States](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%207_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nCut out your state, making sure that the wrong side of the pattern faces the right side of the fabric so that the state is the correct orientation.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Washington Cut Out](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%208_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nContinue cutting out your states, varying your fabrics as you go, for a cute scrappy look. Leave Alaska and Hawaii as one piece on the paper until you have your fabric fused. That way you can keep track of your little islands more easily.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![United States](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%209_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Step 3\nCut your top fabric to 60\" long. You'll leave the width at 45\" - so your top piece will be 45\" x 60\". Lay out your re-taped paper map and then lay your top fabric over the top, centering the fabric over the map. Place Alaska and Hawaii in the bottom left corner.\n\n####Step 4\nBegin removing the paper backing from the states and laying them over the top fabric, lining up all your edges as close as you can. It's ok if they overlap just a bit. Iron all the states in place. I did this on my kitchen island - it is granite and can take the heat.\n\n####Step 5\nOnce your states are all fused down, you can start the applique! Using a medium zig zag stitch, sew between and around all the states.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew your States](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%2010_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nThis will take a bit but I promise it will be worth it! It's so fun to see the states all sewed in place.\n\n![All States are in Place](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%2011_resized.jpg)\n\n####Step 6\nMake a sandwich by laying your backing fabric wrong side up, then your batting, then your top fabric, right side up. Smooth out all the wrinkles, then pin everything together.\n\nQuilt everything together however you'd like. I outlined each state, and the entire map, then filled in the rest of the area with a free motion quilting.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Add Some Free Motion Quilting](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%2012_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Step 7\nNow onto binding! Cut out 2 1/2\" strips of binding from the mint plaid fabric - you'll need 5. Sew the strips together, then press them in half.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![The Binding](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%2013_resized.jpg)\n</p> \n\nBind your quilt in whatever method you normally use.\n\n**Once your quilt is all done, you can pop it in the wash so it gets all soft and crinkly!**\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Completed Map Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Customer%20Appreciation%202016/US%20Map%20Lap%20Quilt%204_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n",

Cut two 17.5” x 25” outer panels along the bias (for bias plaid). Fold vinyl in half and cut a 17.5” x 25” piece with the 25” piece ON THE FOLD. This piece will need to be slightly larger than the plaid to finish the bag.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fold and Cut](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/1_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom your yarn dyed linen cut four strips 9” x 41”. Trim selvedges and sew 2 strips together along the 9” edge. Repeat with the remaining two strips.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut 4 9\"x41\" Strips](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/1_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom remaining piece of linen, cut a 9” x 12.5” piece for pocket panel. From Oilcloth scrap, cut a second 9” x 12.5” piece for pocket lining.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut Your Pocket Panel](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/1_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom your Peltex, cut two 3” x 80” strips. With remaining scraps, cut a 8 - 1/4” x 12” pocket panel insert.\n\n####Step 2: Creating Your Handles\nTake your long strips of yarn dyed linen, and fold them in half to make a strip 4.5” x 80”. Press well and starch if necessary. Insert long strips of Peltex and wrap one side of the linen over the edge of the peltex. Press. Fold remaining raw edge under, press, and using a walking foot, stitch edges closed with a 1/8” seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Make Your Handles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/2_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith your pocket right sides out, insert peltex, press, and fold edges over as in the handles and stitch shut. Add horizontal quilting 1/2” apart as before to stabilize and add texture to your bag.\n\n####Step 4: Attaching Handles & Pocket to Outer Panels\nFold outer plaid panel in half with the 17.5” ends lining up. Create a slight crease. Fold pocket in half with 9” edges lining up. Create a crease. Line up the creases and with the pocket 4” from the top of the bag, stitch the pocket down on the sides and the bottom.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attach the Pocket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/4_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, you’ll attach your handles by overlapping them 1/2” over the pocket on each side, with the ends lining up with the bottom of the bag and the handle curved over the top. Starting 1.5” from the top of the bag, stitch down towards the bottom 1/8” from each edge. Using your first panel as a guide, attach straps to second panel.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attach the Handles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/4_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5: Assembling Your Bag\nWith right sides together, sew the sides and bottom of the outer panels together. With fabric folded, and the right sides together, sew the sides of the lining together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Outer Panels Together](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/5_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith both the lining and the bag exterior, very carefully cut a 2.5” square from the two bottom corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cutting Corners (Literally)](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/5_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFolding the cut edges so that the side seam lines up with the fold, pin and stitch with a 1/2” seam allowance so that you have a nicely boxed corner. Repeat with all remaining corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pinch, Flatten, Sew](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/5_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAfter repeating these steps with your exterior, press seams flat & turn your exterior bag right side out. Insert your lining inside with wrong side out. Line up seams and corners. Your lining should be about 3/4” taller than your exterior. Fold the lining so that the cut edge of the lining fabric is flush with the cut edge of the exterior. Fold over again so that a clean fold is all that is visible. Using binding clips, secure fold all the way around the bag, making sure handles are out of the way.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bind and Secure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/5_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Final Thoughts & Tips for Working with Vinyl\nWorking with vinyl & oilcloth can be really rewarding with just a few tips! First, never iron the shiny side of vinyl. I generally use a pressing cloth whenever I work with shiny fabrics.\nUsing a walking foot is a must! This will keep these layers moving evenly through your machine.\nAlways sew with the softest side down. This will keep your feed dogs happy and prevent the vinyl from getting stuck as is goes through your machine.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Time for the Beach](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Perfect%20Pool%20Tote%20Bag%20Pattern%20-%201_resized.jpg)\n</p>",

Other interfacings will add too much bulk to the top and affect the functionality of the frame.\n\n#####Cutting your Materials\n* From the outer top fabric, cut two pieces 4” wide by 6.5” high. The top will be folded over about 1.25” so place any focal images below 1.5” down from the top.\n* From the Pellon Shape Flex interfacing, cut two pieces 4” wide by 6.5” high. Fuse to the wrong side of the outer top pieces.\n* From the outer bottom material, cut two pieces 4” wide by 3.5” high.\n* From the lining material, cut two pieces 4” wide by 9.5” high.\n* From the batting, cut two pieces 3.5” wide by 9” high.\n\n####Assembling the Pouch\n#####Step 1\nBegin by piecing the outer top and bottom pieces together. Line one outer top and one outer bottom piece up along the bottom 4” edge of the outer top fabric, right sides together. Sew using a 1/4” seam. Repeat for second set of outer fabrics. You may need to use a leather/denim needle depending on the thickness of your material.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Line Top and Bottom Pieces](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigA-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress the outer top fabric up and top stitch along the seamed edge (Fig A). Be careful when pressing not to hit the leather/vinyl with your iron. Set your outer pieces aside.\n\nNext, center your batting pieces on the wrong side of your lining pieces and spray baste or pin in place (the batting will be 1/4” smaller on all sides). Quilt a few lines to secure the batting to the lining (Fig A). This will not be visible as it’s inside the pouch, but helps prevent bunching when turning the piece later.\n\nNOTE: If you do not want/need your pouch padded (such as if you will be using it for pencils vs. eyeglasses), you can eliminate the batting and instead use Shape Flex interfacing on the lining pieces.\n\n#####Step 2\nAfter the outer and lining pieces are prepared, take one of each and, on the wrong side of the fabric, mark lines 2.25” down from the top on all pieces (Fig B).\n\nPlace your two outer pieces right sides together and sew using a scant 1/4” seam starting at one marked line stitching down around the bottom and back up to the other marked line (Fig B left). Be sure to back stitch very well at the start and stop as there will be some tension on this area. Go slowly through the seam where the top and bottom sections are pieced to ensure your tension is tight. Hand crank through or stitch over twice if needed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mark 2.25\" Down](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigB-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, place your two lining pieces right sides together and sew in the same manner using a heavy 1/4” seam, leaving a large gap in the bottom for turning the piece later (Fig B right). Leave most of the bottom open, just turn each corner and sew a few stitches, back stitching well each time you start and stop.\n\n#####Step 3\nNow it’s time to sew the outer pieces and lining together. Place the two pieces with the top openings towards each other and line up the top flaps as shown in Figure C (both will be wrong side out). You will match one outer piece to one lining piece on each side. Pin securely to keep them lined up and in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Pieces Together](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigC-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOne at a time, sew around the edge using a 1/4” seam beginning just above your previously marked line and ending just above the other, once again back stitching well at the beginning and end (Fig D left). Repeat on the other set of flaps.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Around Edge](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigD-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 4\nYou are now ready to turn your entire piece through the gap left in the bottom of the lining. Begin by carefully rolling down your lining piece until you are able to start pulling the outer piece through the opening. Work slowly and carefully and don’t forget about the flaps. Use a thin blunt tool to help with all the corners. Keep working until your outer and lining are both right side out as shown in Figure E (center).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Roll Down Lining Piece](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigE-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe next step is to stitch up the opening in the bottom of your lining. Tuck the raw edges inside and pin to secure. Stitch close to the edge by machine or hand. You can now turn the lining into the pouch. Start by turning the bottom in and slowly continue to roll the lining into itself. A package of bias tape happens to be the perfect size to help push it all the way down inside (Fig E right).\n\n#####Step 5\nOne more step and you’re all done! Give the piece a good press, avoiding the bottom leather and making sure to press the top flaps nice and flat. Pull one flap back and pin to keep it out of the way. Fold the other flap down to where the side seams start, and pin to hold in place. Hand stitch the flap to the lining along the inside bottom edge of the flap. Be sure your needle is only going through the lining fabric and not through the outer fabric (Fig F).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Insert the Frame](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigF-V2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce both flaps are stitched down, you are ready to insert your frame. Slide both sides in at the same time, pushing slowly and adjusting the fabric as needed if the ends catch a bit. Once through, push the fabric back a bit so you can easily close the frame ends together and insert the provided pin (Fig F). Press the metal flaps down over the ends using a pair of pliers or flat head screwdriver and you’re finished!\n\n#####Variations:\nIf preferred, you can use just one fabric for the outside of your pouch, instead of adding a bottom accent, or you can create a patchwork design. If using one solid fabric, cut two pieces 4” wide x 9.5” high of your outer fabric and the Shape Flex interfacing. If using a canvas or heavy fabric, you do not need the interfacing. If creating a patchwork design for the exterior, fuse a piece of Shape Flex interfacing to the back after piecing and then trim to size. Trim to 4” wide x 6.5” high if piecing with a bottom accent, or trim to 4” x 9.5” if creating one solid patchwork exterior.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Bottom Accent](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Pouch%20Open.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTo create the Pencils Pattern pouch shown, download the free pattern above and follow the directions included in the PDF. The height of this pouch can also easily be modified by adding to or subtracting from the height of your pieces. Just be sure to add or subtract equal amounts to the outer, lining, interfacing and batting pieces.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pencil Pouch](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Pencils%20Hero%20Full.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTo create the smaller coin pouch shown above (finished size 3.5\" x 3.5\"), cut your pieces as follows:\n* Outer top fabric and Shape Flex: 4” wide x 3.5” high\n* Outer bottom accent: 4” wide by 2” high\n* Lining Fabric and Shape Flex: 4” wide by 5” high\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Coin Purse](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Coin%20Hero%20Crop.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFollow all the same assembly instructions provided above. Regardless of the height of your pieces, the cutting width will always be 4” when using a 3.5” frame and the same construction method will apply.\n\n**Happy Sewing!**",

Line one outer top and one outer bottom piece up along the bottom 4” edge of the outer top fabric, right sides together. Sew using a 1/4” seam. Repeat for second set of outer fabrics. You may need to use a leather/denim needle depending on the thickness of your material.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigA-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Line Top and Bottom Pieces\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Press the outer top fabric up and top stitch along the seamed edge (Fig A). Be careful when pressing not to hit the leather/vinyl with your iron. Set your outer pieces aside.</p>\n\n<p>Next, center your batting pieces on the wrong side of your lining pieces and spray baste or pin in place (the batting will be 1/4” smaller on all sides). Quilt a few lines to secure the batting to the lining (Fig A). This will not be visible as it’s inside the pouch, but helps prevent bunching when turning the piece later.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: If you do not want/need your pouch padded (such as if you will be using it for pencils vs. eyeglasses), you can eliminate the batting and instead use Shape Flex interfacing on the lining pieces.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"step2\">Step 2</h5>\n\n<p>After the outer and lining pieces are prepared, take one of each and, on the wrong side of the fabric, mark lines 2.25” down from the top on all pieces (Fig B).</p>\n\n<p>Place your two outer pieces right sides together and sew using a scant 1/4” seam starting at one marked line stitching down around the bottom and back up to the other marked line (Fig B left). Be sure to back stitch very well at the start and stop as there will be some tension on this area. Go slowly through the seam where the top and bottom sections are pieced to ensure your tension is tight. Hand crank through or stitch over twice if needed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigB-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Mark 2.25\" Down\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Next, place your two lining pieces right sides together and sew in the same manner using a heavy 1/4” seam, leaving a large gap in the bottom for turning the piece later (Fig B right). Leave most of the bottom open, just turn each corner and sew a few stitches, back stitching well each time you start and stop.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"step3\">Step 3</h5>\n\n<p>Now it’s time to sew the outer pieces and lining together. Place the two pieces with the top openings towards each other and line up the top flaps as shown in Figure C (both will be wrong side out). You will match one outer piece to one lining piece on each side. Pin securely to keep them lined up and in place.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigC-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Pieces Together\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>One at a time, sew around the edge using a 1/4” seam beginning just above your previously marked line and ending just above the other, once again back stitching well at the beginning and end (Fig D left). Repeat on the other set of flaps.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigD-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Around Edge\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h5>\n\n<p>You are now ready to turn your entire piece through the gap left in the bottom of the lining. Begin by carefully rolling down your lining piece until you are able to start pulling the outer piece through the opening. Work slowly and carefully and don’t forget about the flaps. Use a thin blunt tool to help with all the corners. Keep working until your outer and lining are both right side out as shown in Figure E (center).</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigE-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Roll Down Lining Piece\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to stitch up the opening in the bottom of your lining. Tuck the raw edges inside and pin to secure. Stitch close to the edge by machine or hand. You can now turn the lining into the pouch. Start by turning the bottom in and slowly continue to roll the lining into itself. A package of bias tape happens to be the perfect size to help push it all the way down inside (Fig E right).</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"step5\">Step 5</h5>\n\n<p>One more step and you’re all done! Give the piece a good press, avoiding the bottom leather and making sure to press the top flaps nice and flat. Pull one flap back and pin to keep it out of the way. Fold the other flap down to where the side seams start, and pin to hold in place. Hand stitch the flap to the lining along the inside bottom edge of the flap. Be sure your needle is only going through the lining fabric and not through the outer fabric (Fig F).</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/FigF-V2_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Insert the Frame\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Once both flaps are stitched down, you are ready to insert your frame. Slide both sides in at the same time, pushing slowly and adjusting the fabric as needed if the ends catch a bit. Once through, push the fabric back a bit so you can easily close the frame ends together and insert the provided pin (Fig F). Press the metal flaps down over the ends using a pair of pliers or flat head screwdriver and you’re finished!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"variations\">Variations:</h5>\n\n<p>If preferred, you can use just one fabric for the outside of your pouch, instead of adding a bottom accent, or you can create a patchwork design. If using one solid fabric, cut two pieces 4” wide x 9.5” high of your outer fabric and the Shape Flex interfacing. If using a canvas or heavy fabric, you do not need the interfacing. If creating a patchwork design for the exterior, fuse a piece of Shape Flex interfacing to the back after piecing and then trim to size. Trim to 4” wide x 6.5” high if piecing with a bottom accent, or trim to 4” x 9.5” if creating one solid patchwork exterior.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Pouch%20Open.jpg\" alt=\"No Bottom Accent\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>To create the Pencils Pattern pouch shown, download the free pattern above and follow the directions included in the PDF. The height of this pouch can also easily be modified by adding to or subtracting from the height of your pieces. Just be sure to add or subtract equal amounts to the outer, lining, interfacing and batting pieces.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Pencils%20Hero%20Full.jpg\" alt=\"Pencil Pouch\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>To create the smaller coin pouch shown above (finished size 3.5\" x 3.5\"), cut your pieces as follows: <br />\n* Outer top fabric and Shape Flex: 4” wide x 3.5” high\n* Outer bottom accent: 4” wide by 2” high\n* Lining Fabric and Shape Flex: 4” wide by 5” high</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Coin%20Hero%20Crop.jpg\" alt=\"Coin Purse\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Follow all the same assembly instructions provided above. Regardless of the height of your pieces, the cutting width will always be 4” when using a 3.5” frame and the same construction method will apply.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Happy Sewing!</strong></p>",

You'll need:\nOut of white: 2 pieces 6\" x 60\" for side pieces\n2 pieces 2 1/2\" x 12 3/4\"\n2 pieces 2 1/2\" x 4 1/2\"\n1 piece 16 1/2\" x 27 1/2\" (for top shelf piece)\n2 pieces 15 1/2\" x 27 1/2\" (for middle and bottom shelf pieces)\n1 piece 6\" x 27 1/2\"\nFabric for shelves: 2 pieces 2 1/2\" x 42\"\n3 pieces 2 1/2\" x 27 1/2\"\nFabrics for bolts on lowest shelf - one from each fabric - 11\" x 2\"\n8 pieces 1 1/2\" x 1\" for bolt ends\n\nPrint out your pattern pieces and decide what prints you'd like on each piece. Cut slightly larger pieces of fabric than each pattern and iron fusible webbing to the wrong side of the fabrics. Cut out each of the pattern pieces.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Quilted Sewing Machine](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Sewing%20Room%20Quilt/Fabric-Sewing-Machine-Pattern_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew each of the horizontal shelf pieces to the bottom sides of the white shelf pieces. For each shelf, lay out the applique pieces and fuse them in place. Trace your detail stitching in place on all the shelves.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Room Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Sewing%20Room%20Quilt/Sewing-Quilt-Shelf_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake each shelf and do any detail stitching first using free motion stitching. For example, the lines on the pincushion, the pins, the detailing on the lettering. Once you have all your detail stitching finished, zigzag all the applique pieces in place using a small zigzag stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Quilted Sew](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Sewing%20Room%20Quilt/Free-Motion-Lettering_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the flowers, sew little free motion stitching lines in a star shape, then sew little circles at the end of each spoke.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Quilted Flowers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Sewing%20Room%20Quilt/Applique-Flowers-for-Quilt_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce you have your shelves all appliqued, assemble your quilt top. Sew each of the shelves together top to bottom. Under the lowest shelf, sew the 6\" x 27 1/2\" white rectangle. For each of the vertical shelves, sew a 2 1/2\" x 12 3/4\" white piece to one side and a 2 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" piece to the other side. Sew these strips on each side of the center shelves. Sew the 6\" x 60\" pieces on each side of the vertical shelves. Your quilt top is all finished!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Quilted Front](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/Sewing%20Room%20Quilt/Sewing-Room-Quilt-Top_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nQuilt and bind your quilt in whatever what you'd like. I straight stitched around all appliques and the shelving, and did a free motion meandering quilting in all the white spaces.

Nothing feels more luxurious and cozy than the feel of fur… faux fur! A fur coat is a glam way to layer for cooler days. This fall’s fashion trends definitely include fur: animal prints, textures, and even beautiful jewel toned colors. Best of all, you can find all of these fur trends here on fabric.com.\n\nI have some tips to share to make your faux fur sewing projects a success. Sewing with faux fur is really so simple if you know the right way to work with it. Don’t fear the fur!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![The Sara Project Faux Fur](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/FullSizeRender_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Materials:\n* 2 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/chinchilla-faux-fur-collection?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-faux_fur_coat_tutorial-_-chinchilla_faux_fur\" target=\"_blank\">Faux Fur</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0440427/faux-fur-forest-fox-platinum?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-faux_fur_coat_tutorial-_-0440427\" target=\"_blank\">Forest Fox Platinum</a>)\n* Sharp Scissors\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=clover&SearchText=clover+awl&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-faux_fur_coat_tutorial-_-clover_awl\" target=\"_blank\">Clover Awl</a>\n* One package of 10 <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0334192/clover-wonder-clips?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-faux_fur_coat_tutorial-_-wonder_clips\" target=\"_blank\">wonder clips</a>\n* Schmetz Universal <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=schmetz&product-type=needles&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-faux_fur_coat_tutorial-_-schmetz_universal_needle\" target=\"_blank\">Needle</a> (90 works best)\n* Pins\n* <a href=\"https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m7257\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern</a>\n\n\nBefore you begin, there are a few things to do. First, find the direction of the hairs (or nap) by using your hand to brush the fur along the grain, you want to make sure the fur tips are going in the direction of the natural flow of the fur.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Find the Faux Fur nap](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur1_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, I like to draw an arrow on the knit backing of the faux fur, showing the natural direction the fur is going. This helps when you are getting ready to place and cut out your pattern pieces. You want to make sure your fur is going in the correct direction when cutting your pattern out.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Draw an Arrow point the Direction of Fur](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur2_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, lay out your pattern pieces, and lightly pin them to the wrong side (knit backing of your faux fur)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pin your Pattern](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur3_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUsing a straight edge, like a ruler, trace your pattern directly onto the wrong side of your fabric. I just used a regular pen. (You won’t be able to see the markings at all when finished). You will need to cut one pattern piece out at a time on a single layer of your faux fur fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Use a Ruler](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur4_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Trace Your Pattern](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur5_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow it’s time to cut! When cutting your fur, make sure to just barely snip through the knit backing layer of your fur. This can take some time, go slow. If you were to cut straight through your fur, you would get a blunt fur edge along your seams, which would change the length of the fur at the seam. Start slowly, and you will find you get a feel for it as you go. (It helps to practice on a scrap piece first!).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut Slowly and Carefully](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur6_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAs you cut, you will notice the different directions of the fur as you cut through the different angles of your pattern. Here’s an example of some of my pieces while cutting.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Example of Cuts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur8_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Example #2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur9_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce you have all your pattern pieces cut out, it’s time to pin. I recommend using Wonder Clips to pin your two pieces together. They do a really good job of securing the pieces, and keeping the fur from popping back up. Regular pins slipped out, and didn’t hold the hairs down in the seam. When pinning your fabric and lining pieces together, use your finger as you pin to brush the fur inside the seam. Again, take your time. Use your Wonder Clips to clip your two pieces together as you go. You don’t want any fur coming out of your seam allowance. (When pinning along the bottom hem edge of your projects, it can be tricky getting all the hairs inside the seam because they want to point downwards. Do the best you can, it’s okay if a few pieces are poking out).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Use Wonder Clips](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur10_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Use Wonder Clips 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur11_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Use Wonder Clips 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur12_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAs you are sewing your pieces together, use your awl to gently push any fur pieces that have popped out of the seam edge back into the seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Push Fur Pieces Back](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur17_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhen sewing two pieces of fur together, use your fingers and your awl to gently push the hairs inside the seam as you again clip them together with your Wonder Clips.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Use Your Awl](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur15_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI also found it helpful to use my awl to gently pull out any pieces of hair that may have gotten caught in the stitching after sewing two pieces together. (Especially in that hem edge I talked about earlier). This will help give your coat a really beautiful, full look around the seams and hem when finished.\n\nWhen prepping your sleeves, make sure to gently push the fur down with your finger as you sew in your ease stitches as shown below:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Prepping Sleeves](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur16_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew on your SLeeves](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Tutorials/fur%20coat/fur19_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThat’s all there is to it.

You can also finish them later with pinking shears.\n\n#####Step 2\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attach Your Invisable Zipper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow10.jpg)\n</p> \n\nOn the bottom of one piece of fabric, attach one side of the invisible zipper to the right side of the fabric by sewing it on with your invisible zipper foot. The grooves in the foot will match up with the zipper teeth, so the needle can get as close to the teeth as possible. The back of the zipper with the exposed teeth will be facing up. Attach the other piece of fabric to the other side of the zipper in the same way, being careful not to twist.\n\nYou should be able to zip it shut now to test it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Invisible Zipper Front](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow4.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Invisible Zipper Back](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow5.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step 3\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Your Edges](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow2.jpg)\n</p> \n\nOpen the zipper halfway, so you can turn the pillow inside-out when you’re through. Sew around the open edges of the two squares of fabric, right sides together.\n\nWhen you get to the edges by the zipper, pull the zipper away you can sew up the corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Your Edges 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow3.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step four\nTrim the excess zipper edges off – if you cut off the zipper stop, make sure you sew across the zipper tape so that your zipper head doesn’t come off. Cut the corners diagonally next to the stitching. Turn inside out and stuff with your pillow-form.\n\n####Envelope Closure Pillows \nWe used [these fabrics!](https://www.fabric.com/collection/european-100percent-linen?cm_re=CustomerAppreciation-_-PillowProduct_Linen-_-5.3.16)\n\n#####Step one\nCut one piece of fabric the size of the pillow form plus 1” for seam allowance. Cut another two pieces for the back of the pillow so they will be a few inches shorter than the front piece. These two pieces will overlap to form an envelope closure on the back of the pillow. For example, for 16” square pillow forms, we cut 1 17” square and 2 12”x17” pieces.\n\n#####Step two\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ironing Helps](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow6.jpg)\n</p> \n\nOn one 17” side of each of the back pieces, fold the edge over to the wrong side .5”and press and then again another .5” and press again.\n\nTop stitch these pieces on the front side of the folded edge\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Top Stich these Pieces](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow7.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step three\n<p align=\"center\">\n![All Done](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Project%20of%20the%20week%20/Pillows/Project_pillow8.jpg)\n</p> \n\nArrange and pin the pieces so that the two smaller pieces overlap in the center, with the bottom piece overlapping the top.\n\n#####Step four\nSew around all four sides with a 3/8” seam allowance, pivoting at the corners.

You never know when you’ll have that special project that needs an invisible hem.  Blind hems are perfect on any garment made from medium to lightweight fabric with a 1″ or deeper hem.\n\nToday we will show you how to sew a blind hem by hand as well as on your domestic sewing machine.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/TieDyeDiva-16.jpg)\n</p>\n\n######Materials:\n\n* Garment needing a hem.

This is just a sample piece of fabric here, but you’ll work on your actual garment. Fold and press the hem as directed in your pattern.  I have used a hem folded up 1/2″ then another 1″.  This is the narrowest hem that works well with a blind hem.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 2: Prepare Hem for Stitching\nBaste hem 3/8″ from the upper edge (this measurement may vary depending on your blind hem foot so check your instructions, but somewhere between 3/16″ and 3/8″ is good). It’s OK to use contrasting thread here, you’ll be removing it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_2_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold Hem to the right side along basting stitches. Do not iron.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_2_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_2_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 3: Sewing the Blind Hem\nThread your machine with thread that closely matches your fabric (we’re still using contrasting thread for easier visibility for you) and select the blind hem stitch.  Refer to your sewing machine manual for help selecting the stitch and proper sewing foot.\n\nWhen sewing a machine blind hem, most stitches will be sewn into the folded area of the hem while the zig-zag stitch will just barely bite into the hem folded along the basting line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_3_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHere’s what it looks like sewing on my machine. Your Blind hem foot may look different.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_3_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the hem back down and press well. Remove your basting stitches.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_3_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom the inside of the garment.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_3_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\nBeautifully invisible from the outside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/skirt_3_5.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/TieDyeDiva-17.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow let’s move on to sewing a blind hem by hand.  A hand-stitched blind hem is especially helpful on very delicate fabrics. It’s perfect for this light weight Liberty lawn.\n\n#####Step 1: Press Folded Hem\nThis step is exactly the same as a machine-stitched blind hem. Prepare garment to the point of sewing the hem (We’re again using a fabric scrap and contrasting thread for easier visibility – you will sew on your finished garment with matching thread.) Fold and iron the hem as directed in your pattern.  I have used a hem folded up 1/2″ then another 1″.  This is the narrowest hem that works well with a blind hem. Pin the hem in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%201_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 2: Sewing the Blind Hem\nThread your hand sewing needle with a length of all-purpose thread about 18″-24″ in a color closely matching your fabric.  Using a single strand of thread, knot one end.  Secure the knot inside the top edge fold of your hem.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHere I have unfolded the hem to secure my knot.\n\nNext take a TINY bite of fabric just above the folded hem, this should just be a couple threads of the fabric. I have taken a slightly larger stitch merely for visibility’s sake.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow, run the needle into the folded edge of the hem for about 3/8″.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat these two steps to complete the hem. Here I have loosened the thread so you can see the flow of stitches.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIn matching thread, this hem is simply stunning and invisible.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_5.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/top%202_6.jpg)\n</p>\n\nGive it a nice press to set the stitches and you’re done!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blind Hem Hero 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blind%20Hem/TieDyeDiva-5.jpg)\n</p>",

A ¼” seam allowance has been included around the pieces- make sure to cut on the dashed lines and not the solid lines!\n\n######Step Two\nGrab your markers or colored pencils.  To keep track of what fabric goes where, it’s helpful to color the template of the whole house (and it’s fun to color).  \n\n######Step Three\nStart sewing! Fabric can be cut as you go, or you can pre-cut some pieces.  I found that I generally cut 1 ½”, 2 ½”, and 3” strips.  The windows also lend themselves great to fussy cutting, add a few skulls, spider webs, or spooky cats.    \n\nFabrics for Fussy Cutting:\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0443114/cotton-steel-boo-halloween-beads-black?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-haunted_house_quilt-_-0443114\">Cotton + Steel Boo Halloween Beads Black</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-spellbound?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-haunted_house_quilt-_-spellbound\">Cotton + Steel Spellbound Metallic Floral</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0443113/cotton-steel-boo-my-pet-skeleton-teal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-haunted_house_quilt-_-0443113\">Cotton + Steel Boo My Pet Skeleton Teal</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Completed Sewing Room Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Haunted%20House%20Quilt/Img_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n######Step Four\nWith everything sewn and trimmed, it’s time to assemble the house and hill.  Follow the guide below for putting the pieces together, press seams open or to the side with the least resistance.\n\nExample: Sew B1 to B2 to B3 to B4 to B5, sew B6 to the bottom of that section, then sew B7 to the side, and finally sew B8 to the bottom\n\n* A1 + A2\n* (((B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 + B5) + B6) + B7) + B8\n* C1 + C2\n* D1 + D2\n* (((E3 + E4 + E5 + E6 + E7) + E2 + E8) + E9) + E1\n* ((G1 + G2) + G3 + G4 + G5) + G6\n* (((i1 + i2) + i3 + i4) + i5 + i6) + i7 + i8\n* ((J3 + J4 + J5 + J6 + J7 + J8) + J1 + J2) +J9\n* Hill1 + Hill2 + Hill3 + Hill4 + Hill5\n\nOnce all the individual sections are sewn together, the house can be put together in the following order- press seams open or to the side with the least resistance.\n\nExample: Sections A, B, and C have been assembled, sew section B to C, then attach A to the top\n\n* A\n* B + C\n* D\n* (F + G) + E\n* (H + i) + J\n* K + L\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Completed Sewing Room Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Haunted%20House%20Quilt/Img_CloseUp_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n######Step Five \nAdd the background and ground fabric. Press seams to the side. Sew a 21 ½ x 16 ½” rectangle of background fabric to the top of the hill.  \n\nBetween the house and hill sew a 30 ½ x 3” strip of background fabric, connecting the house to the hill. \n\nSew a 36 x 3” strip of ground fabric to the bottom.  \n\n######Step Six\nTime for the applique! Raw-edge applique works well for this project, with either a blanket stitch edge or free-motion quilting to sew the edges down.  \n\nFollow the fusible webbing directions for attaching to fabric. \n\nCut out the fence (a precision knife is helpful for this one), clouds, moon, and grave markers.  Place and iron onto the quilt top.  Then either embroider or sew around the edges. \n\n######Step Seven\nMake your quilt sandwich and quilt with your desired pattern.  I used free-motion quilting for this piece, with a loop pattern in the sky and pebbles for the ground.\n\n######Step Eight\nPrepare and attach binding. \n\nI was recently introduced to continuous bias binding and it’s a huge time (and fabric) saver, I highly recommend it.  Using the continuous bias binding method, cut a 22” square piece of fabric, to make 2 ½” binding strips. \n\nNow all you need to do is find the perfect spot to display your Witch’s House!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Completed Sewing Room Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Haunted%20House%20Quilt/Img_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/18285985/?claim=ye3f9pf7qs8\">Follow my blog with Bloglovin</a>",

The orange fabric will be our background (goose) and the black fabric will be our cat ears (sky). The point usually faces north, but we’ll be flipping it for our cat’s ears, so keep that in mind if your fabric is directional.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/9%EF%80%A230%20content10.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMark a diagonal line on your 3.5” squares, make sure it’s straight! \n\nPlace one square on the right end of your orange 6.5”x3.5” rectangle, the line will be going from left to right (top to bottom). Sew right on that line you made from one side to the other, being careful not to stray.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/9%EF%80%A230%20content13.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut off the extra triangle of black and orange fabrics, to the right of your seam, to reduce bulk. Press towards the black fabric.\n\nNow we’ll repeat the process on the left side of the rectangle. Place your second 3.5” square on the left side, diagonal line going left to right (bottom to top). Stitch on this line as you did with the other, and trim as before.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/9%EF%80%A230%20content11.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow press, now you have your goose! The space between the tip of the triangle and the edge of the fabric should be about ¼”.\n\nSew your finished flying goose to your 6.5”x6.5” black square, right sides together. Make sure you are sewing the point side of the goose and not the base side. Press towards the square, voila, a simple cat!\n\nNow, we’ll sew your cat block to the “frame”, here is the general layout.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/Capture%20One%20Catalog32658.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, we’ll be sewing  the two 7”x 9.5” orange rectangles to the left and right of your cat block. Match the 9.5” sides together and sew right sides together, repeat with the other side. Press these seams towards the orange fabric.\n\nSew the 5”x 19.5” strips to the top and bottom in the same fashion. Press. Now you’ll have an (almost) finished pillow front. All that’s left is the quilting.\n\nTo quilt, take your batting square and pin to the wrong side of your pillow front. Pin with straight pins or safety pins. Normally when quilting, you would have a backing as well, and the front and back would “sandwich” the batting, but this isn’t necessary when making a pillow. \n\nQuilt this as desired. You can do a grid over the whole thing, free motion quilt, or another design. I did some simple lines that avoided the middle and intersected in the corners in a grid pattern.\n\nOnce your quilting is finished, trim your pillow front to be 19” square.\n\nNow we’ll prepare the back two pieces.\n \nWe need to hem one 19” side of each 15”x19” piece. Do this by folding over the 19” edge by .5”, pressing, and then folding over another .5” so that the raw edge is encased. Topstitch this with a 3/8” seam allowance to finish.\n\nNow, we’ll assemble the finished pillow. Lay the pillow front right side up, and lay one back piece right side down, matching the bottom edges, making sure the finished edge is towards the middle. Lay the second backing piece going the other direction, raw edges to the remaining raw edge of the pillow. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/930%20content09_retouch.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe right sides of the hemmed edges will be facing the right side of the pillow front. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/930%20content14_retouch.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin carefully so that you will catch all layers as you sew. \n\nSew around all edges with a 3/8” seam allowance, clip corners, and turn. Stuff with your pillow form and you are all done!\n\nHappy Halloween, everyone!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Halloween Pillow](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Halloween%20Cat%20Pillow/catpillow2.jpg)\n</p>\n",

You won’t need that many, but it’s always nice to have an extra or two!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics_1_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Two\nCut the remaining Oyster metallic linen into 2.5” strips on the bias to use as your binding. (If you’ve never made bias or quilt binding before, <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/ehow-crafts/blog/the-beauty-of-bias-tape-part-1-make-your-own/\" target=\"_blank\">here's a great tutorial</a> for cutting the bias strips. You won’t need a bias tape maker though; after your strips are cut and stitched together, just fold the strips in half lengthwise, aligning the raw edges together, and press with a hot steam iron.)\n\n#####Step Three: Pair your 2.5” squares into the following 2-square units:\n* 1 unit – Camel + Black (1 Camel square + 1 Black square)\n* 3 units – Camel + Camel ([1 Camel square + 1 Camel square] x 3)\n* 2 units – Camel + Sand ([1 Camel square + 1 Sand square] x 2)\n* 2 units – Sand + Sand ([1 Sand square + 1 Sand square] x 2)\n* 1 unit – Sand + Black (1 Sand square + 1 Black square)\n* 1 unit – Sand + Oyster (1 Sand square + 1 Oyster square)\n* 3 units – Sand + Black ([1 Sand square + 1 Black square] x 3)\n* 2 units – Oyster + Oyster ([1 Oyster square + 1 Oyster square] x 2)\n* 1 unit – Black + Black (1 Black square + 1 Black square)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-3_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Making the HST Blocks\n\n#####Step Four\nGlue baste your 2-square units together, drawing a thin line of glue from one corner of a square to the opposite corner. Heat set the glue using a hot, dry iron.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-11_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n#####Step Five\nStitch the squares together by sewing a scant ¼” seam on each side of the glue line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-13_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Six\nCut your squares in half along the glue line\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-16_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Seven\nPress the seams of your HST blocks to one side; trim squares to 2”.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-17_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Piecing the Pineapple Block\nI prefer to piece in blocks, rather than strips. I also prefer to glue baste, nest, and “spin” my seams, all of which I learned from tutorials by Cristy Fincher from Purple Daisies Quilting. (For Cristy’s excellent tutorial on nesting and spinning seams, click here) Nesting and spinning seams when piecing blocks has helped me create more accurate seams and perfect points; it also creates flatter blocks, which in turn are easier to quilt.\n\n#####Step Eight\nLay out your HST blocks in the following pattern to create your pineapple:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-20_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Nine\nBegin piecing your blocks, using your preferred method. Since I like to piece in blocks when I can, rather than strips, I create 2-block units first. Apply a thin line of glue along one edge of a block, place the “partner” block on top (right sides together and raw edges aligned), and heat set the glue with a hot, dry iron. Stitch the two blocks together using a scant ¼” seam. I leave about a ¼” space at the start and end of my seam—I don’t sew completely end to end. This will allow me to spin my seams as I piece more blocks together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-24_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Ten\nAfter stitching each set of 2-block units, press the seams to one side. I alternate the pressing direction by row, beginning by pressing the seams of the bottom row blocks to the right. The row above that gets pressed to the left, then the next row to the right, and so on. Because the seams are pressed to alternating sides, as we build our units from two blocks to four blocks, our seams will nest and spin. Here’s a picture of the wrong sides of my 2-block units, so you can see how I’ve pressed the seams in alternate directions.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-25_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Eleven\nYou’ll begin to nest your seams when you start piecing two sets of 2-block units together to create a 4-block unit. You can see in this picture how the pressed edges of the center seams for these two 2-block units meet in the middle. This is nesting your seams.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-26_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Twelve\nFollow the same procedures to piece two 2-block units into 4-block units: glue baste, heat set, and stitch using a scant ¼” seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-28_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Thirteen\nAfter you’ve stitched all your 2-block units together, it’s time to press the seams open. This time, you’ll spin your seams. Make sure the four seams are pressed so that they rotate around the center—think of them going either clockwise or counterclockwise. (My seams always end up spinning counterclockwise—I don’t know if that’s typical or because I’m left-handed!) To do that, you’ll have to press your most recent seam in opposite directions from the center. That little ¼” you left unstitched at the start and finish of each seam will allow the center to open up and flatten out, and you’ll get a lovely little 4-square “block” in the very center of your spinning seams.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-29_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Fourteen\nYou may want to starch your blocks as you press them open.\n\n#####Step Fifteen\nContinue piecing your blocks together until your pineapple is complete.\n\n#####Step Sixteen\nAdd the sashing, beginning with the left and right side sashings.\n\n#####Step Seventeen\nCreate a sandwich using your fabric backing on the bottom (wrong side up), batting in the middle, and pieced pineapple on top (right side up). I spray baste each layer, rather than using pins, to keep the layers from shifting.\n\n#####Step Eighteen\nQuilt the layers together using your favorite method. I machine quilted my pineapple using straight-line quilting. I don’t have a walking foot for my vintage sewing machine and it still looks great, so even if you aren’t a regular quilter with all the regular tools, you can still quilt a project this size!\n\n#####Step Nineteen\nTrim the edges of your quilted block so that they are neat and straight. Pin your stitched and pressed quilt binding onto the front of your quilted piece, raw edges aligned. Machine stitch the binding using a scant ¼” seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-38_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step Twenty\nHand stitch the binding to the back of your quilted piece. Here you can see that I added a couple of fabric triangles to the back in the top left and right corners; I’ll use these to hang my pineapple on the wall. I used a couple of those extra fabric squares and some fabric glue to put them on, and hand stitching the binding will strengthen them.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-33_resized.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThat’s it! You’re all done with your modern metallic ombre pineapple. The pineapple is a symbol of hospitality, especially for us Southerners, and I can’t wait to hang this one in my foyer! I hope you’re inspired to make one for yourself!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pineapple Mini Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/MWP_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Hero%20Pics%20Rd%202_8_resized.jpg)\n</p>",

Here you can see that I added a couple of fabric triangles to the back in the top left and right corners; I’ll use these to hang my pineapple on the wall. I used a couple of those extra fabric squares and some fabric glue to put them on, and hand stitching the binding will strengthen them.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Pineapple%20Mini%20Quilt/My%20Wandering%20Path_Metallic%20Ombre%20Pineapple_Tutorial%20Pics-33_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Pineapple Mini Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>That’s it! You’re all done with your modern metallic ombre pineapple. The pineapple is a symbol of hospitality, especially for us Southerners, and I can’t wait to hang this one in my foyer!

If you’d rather a rectangle, get as much or as little as you like. If you’re using 60” wide fabric, make sure to get 2 yards for a larger square. The quality of the flannel will impact how long you can make your fringe and how easy it is to make your fringe. If you want a long fringe, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?collection=kaufman-mammoth-flannel&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-no_sew_blanket_scarf-_-kaufman_mammoth_flannel\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel</a>, which is thicker and of a nice quality. \n\nFor all projects that are going to be washed sometime in the future (which I hope you plan on doing), pre-wash your fabrics to shrink it before you start working on them.\n\n####Step One: Trim up Two Sides\nPick two sides that come together at a corner. They will be a selvedge edge and a cut edge. The selvedge edge will have a lot less stray threads that have unraveled.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1783.JPG)\n</p>\n\nOn the cut edges, pick a line of plaid that continues down the length and trim along it as neatly as possible.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1787.JPG)\n</p>\nNow, trim the selvedge edge in the same fashion. Pick a line of plaid that extends past the dense selvedge. If you leave the selvedge on, those edges won’t fringe properly.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1789.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\n####Step Two: Square up Your Fabric\nSquare up your fabric by folding the two edges you just trims into a right triangle at the corner, with the edges as even as possible, all the way to the other, untrimmed edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1790.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe excess will extend either on the top or bottom of your piece.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1793.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut the excess off, following a line of the plaid. It doesn’t have to be exactly square, but pick the line of plaid closest to the matching edge. Trim the other edge also, picking a plaid line as close to the other as possible, so that they’re mostly even.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1795.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Step Three: Make the Fringe\nThis step will be the longest step, but it’s super easy. Sit down in front of the tv with your seam ripper and start fringing!\n\nStart at one edge. With your seam ripper, pick one thread and follow it all the way down to the other side and remove it. Try not to cut it. If it breaks, find the break and continue on. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1807.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou can also do it a couple of threads at a time but this can get messy. You might want to try it when you become more confident with it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/IMG_1804.JPG)\n</p>\n\nKeep pulling out threads until you have the size of fringe you want, and repeat with the other three sides. I stopped at about ½”. You can make it as long or short as you want.\n\n####Four: Wearing your Blanket Scarf\n\nYour scarf is ready to wear! Here's how we love to wear ours:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/step_1_looking_down.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/step_2_looking_down.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/step_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/step_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Blanket Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blanket%20Scarf/hero.jpg)\n</p>\n\n",

                        "markdown": "Happy Friday and welcome to Week 1 of the fabric.com Log Cabin Sew-Along!\n\nIn case you missed the announcement last week, here’s a quick recap: Over the next several weeks, we’ll be hosting a quilt-as-you-go log cabin blanket sew-along here on the Fabric.com blog. Today we’re kicking off the sew-along with a discussion on choosing fabrics and yardage requirements. Then we’ll review the quilt-as-you-go method and start our blankets. \n\nLet’s start by going over what you’ll need for the sew-along! \n\n#####Quilt-as-You-Go Log Cabin Sew-Along Fabric Requirements\nThis quilt-as-you-go log cabin quilt is a lap-sized quilt that finishes at approximately 55”x55”. My version features nine different fabrics for the body of the quilt (three solids and six plaids), plus a contrasting sashing and binding.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%202/table.png)\n</p>\n\n*Please note that for my quilt, I am not overly concerned about pattern matching for my plaid logs. My strips are a little wonky, and I’m OK with that…but if you like your plaids to match perfectly and your lines to be super straight, more power to you—and maybe get a little extra fabric!\n\n**Using wider width fabric allows us to cut not only the strips for the log cabin piecing, but also three 15” squares for block backings from each plaid fabric. If you choose a plaid that is less than 58” wide, please make sure to order extra fabric. Or, if you decide to use a different fabric entirely for the back of your blocks, you’ll need enough fabric to cut 16- 15” squares.\n\n#####Choosing Your Fabrics\n\nI had a hard time narrowing down my fabric choices for this project! There are just so many fun plaids available right now. I really wanted to incorporate a variety of plaids in my quilt, but I also wanted to figure out how to keep it from being visually overwhelming. So I decided to create my log cabin blocks using a mix of solids and plaids, arranged like this:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%202/block.png)\n</p>\n\nDid you know that Fabric.com has a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/DesignWall.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-log_cabin_sew_along_2-_-design_wall\" target=\"_blank\">design wall</a> feature? It’s a great way to visualize how your fabric choices will look together before you commit to buying them! I definitely made good use of the design wall when I was trying to decide on my final fabrics.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%202/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%201_design%20wall%20screenshot.png)\n</p>\n\nI chose three solid colors—green, blue, and red—and a coordinating light/medium plaid and dark plaid for each of the solids. Each log cabin block will feature a solid and one of the plaids on the front, while the other coordinating plaid will be used for the backing fabric for that block. (In other words, if I use a light-value green plaid for the “logs” of the block, the dark-value green plaid will be the backing fabric for the block, and vice versa.) \n\nMixing solids and plaids for the log cabins helps tame the riot of plaid on the front of the block, especially with all of that directional piecing. But having a large square of plaid for the back of the block is not as overwhelming and also helps to disguise the quilting lines!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%202/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%201_post%20pic_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor my green colorway, I chose this amazing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0404872/kaufman-shetland-flannel-herringbone-basil?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-log_cabin_sew_along_2-_-0404872\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kaufman Shetland Flannel Herringbone</a> in Basil, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0466172/yarn-dyed-flannel-plaid-navy-green-oat?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-log_cabin_sew_along_2-_-0466172\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Navy/Green/Oat Plaid</a> for my medium-value plaid, and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0427081/yarn-dyed-flannel-plaid-green?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-log_cabin_sew_along_2-_-0427081\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Green Plaid</a> for the dark-value plaid.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%202/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%201_post%20pic_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIsn’t this herringbone flannel gorgeous?

This is my first time using wool batting, so I’m excited to see how it turns out! \n\n#####Single Nap vs. Double Nap\nSingle nap or double nap: it sounds like the kind of decision I’d love to make in the middle of the day, but it actually refers to how flannel fabric is finished. The woven fabric is napped, or brushed, on either one or both sides. That’s what gives flannel fabric that softness we love! \n\nIt’s OK if you choose single-napped flannels for this project (several of the fabrics I chose are single napped), as long as you pay close attention when piecing your blocks and make sure the soft and cozy napped side is facing out!\n\n#####Looking for More Fabric Inspiration?\n\nFabric.com has a ton of plaid flannels to choose from. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel&product-features=yarn-dyed&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-no_sew_blanket_scarf-_-yarn_dyed_flannel_plaid\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to see just a few of the styles available right now!\n\n\nI wanted to leave you with a little sneak peek of how the finished blocks will look.

If you have a sewing technique you'd like us to highlight in this series, please let us know in the comments section. Today is all about seam allowances!\n\nKnowing what seam allowances are and how execute an accurate seam allowance is arguably the most important part of sewing (aside from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-home_page\" target=\"_blank\">selecting the perfect fabric</a>). Without an accurate seam allowance, your project can end up too large, too small, or too… disastrous.\n\nWhether you primarily quilt, sew garments, or home décor – they all use seam allowances. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/quilting-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-quilting_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">Shop quilting fabrics</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-apparel_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">Shop apparel fabrics</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-home_decor_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">Shop home decor fabrics</a>\n\n######There are three standard seam allowances:\n* ¼”\n* 3/8”\n* 5/8”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1838.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe 3/8” seam is usually the first line, the 5/8” the second. Your machine may be different. A ¼” seam is primarily used in piecing quilts. 5/8” is the standard seam allowance for sewing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-apparel_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">apparel</a>. And you’ll see a 3/8” seam allowance in various sewing circles, including garments and other sewing projects. Always check your pattern or tutorial for seam allowances before starting! You can get yourself into some seriously hot water if you don’t, or at least some quality time with your seam ripper.\n\n#####1/4\":\n\nFor an accurate ¼” seam, you will need a good ¼” piecing foot. Some of them will be exactly ¼” wide, and some of them will have markings showing you where your ¼” seam should be. Others have handy guides to keep your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-home_page\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> in the right place. Mine is clear with red markings. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1842.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFor quilting, many (including myself), recommend using a scant ¼” seam. This is to allow a little ease for your fabric once your seam allowances are pressed properly. \n\nThis is a ¼” seam: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1853.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThis is a scant ¼” seam:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1855.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou’ll notice that the standard ¼” seam is right on the ¼” line on my piecing foot. The scant ¼” seam has a little bit of space between that red line and the fabric.\n\nWhen I started using scant ¼” seams instead of standard ¼” seams in my quilting, my accuracy increased exponentially! I was suddenly creating blocks that were the right size, instead of a little bit too small! It’s up to you, though. Test which one gives you more accurate results and go from there.\n\n#####3/8\":\nThe wonderful thing about sewing machines is that they have markings for 3/8” and 5/8”. Some have more. If they aren’t properly labeled, you can always use a trusty ruler, seam gauge, or other measuring tool to figure out which is which.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1843.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe 3/8” marking on my machine is the first one.  Keep your fabric on that line for an accurate seam, and don’t stray!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1858.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####5/8\":\nThis is the standard seam allowance for sewing apparel. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1844.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThis leaves lots of room for alterations, tweaking, and a variety of seam finishing techniques. This is also the widest seam allowance you will usually find specified in sewing projects – except perhaps for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-home_decor_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">home decor</a> projects.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1861.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHappy Sewing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Seam Allowances](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/sewing101facebookCover_seamAllow.jpg)\n</p>",

Mine is clear with red markings. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1842.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For quilting, many (including myself), recommend using a scant ¼” seam. This is to allow a little ease for your fabric once your seam allowances are pressed properly. </p>\n\n<p>This is a ¼” seam: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1853.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This is a scant ¼” seam:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1855.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that the standard ¼” seam is right on the ¼” line on my piecing foot. The scant ¼” seam has a little bit of space between that red line and the fabric.</p>\n\n<p>When I started using scant ¼” seams instead of standard ¼” seams in my quilting, my accuracy increased exponentially! I was suddenly creating blocks that were the right size, instead of a little bit too small! It’s up to you, though. Test which one gives you more accurate results and go from there.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"38\">3/8\":</h5>\n\n<p>The wonderful thing about sewing machines is that they have markings for 3/8” and 5/8”. Some have more. If they aren’t properly labeled, you can always use a trusty ruler, seam gauge, or other measuring tool to figure out which is which.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1843.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The 3/8” marking on my machine is the first one.  Keep your fabric on that line for an accurate seam, and don’t stray!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1858.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"58\">5/8\":</h5>\n\n<p>This is the standard seam allowance for sewing apparel. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1844.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This leaves lots of room for alterations, tweaking, and a variety of seam finishing techniques. This is also the widest seam allowance you will usually find specified in sewing projects – except perhaps for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_seam_allowance-_-home_decor_category_page\" target=\"_blank\">home decor</a> projects.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/IMG_1861.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy Sewing!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Allowances/sewing101facebookCover_seamAllow.jpg\" alt=\"Sewing 101 Seam Allowances\" />\n</p>",

I promise, this will be one of the easiest cutting sessions you’ll ever have. Before you dive into the specifics, here are a couple of tips:\n\n1) If you’re using the same fabrics I am, you’ll only use the solid flannels for log cabin strips. You can go ahead and start by cutting your fabric into 2½” x width of fabric (WOF) strips and subcutting those strips according to the chart below.\n\n2) We’ll use the plaid flannels for our block backing fabric as well as for log cabin strips. Start by cutting the three 15”x15” pieces for the block backings, then cut the rest of the fabric into 2½”xWOF strips before subcutting those strips according to the chart below. (That way, you’ll be sure to have enough for your backing pieces!)\n\n3) For the sashing and binding, I found it easier to cut the binding strips (on the bias) first, and then cut the sashing strips (not on the bias). \n\nIt’s easy to cut the fabric for this sew-along because all of our log cabin strips will be cut at 2½” wide. By starting with those 2½”xWOF strips, it’s quick to subcut them into the various lengths for the log cabin pieces. (And it’s easy to remember the length of the log cabin strips because they increase in 2” increments from 2½” to 14½”.)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/table.png)\n</p>\n\n#####Let’s Start Quilting!\n(First, let me say that obviously I am not the inventor of the quilt-as-you-go log cabin block! There are lots of great tutorials for the quilt-as-you-go method. This quick overview is adapted from Rachel at Stitched in Color and you can find her original tutorial here.)\n\nFinally! We have all your fabric strips and backing blocks and batting blocks cut. Now we can get to the good part!\n\nHere’s how the construction and quilting of our flannel log cabin blocks will work: We’ll start by quilting our center block, and then one by one, stitch and quilt each log, spiraling out from the center. So if we look again at the diagram from last week, I’ve numbered the logs in the order that they are added to the block:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](http://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/block.png)\n</p>\n\n#####The Quilt-as-You-Go Log Cabin Block\nDecide on the backing fabric for your block. Take a 15” x 15” square of that fabric, place it wrong side up (the “smooth” side, if you’re using single-napped flannel), spray with a little basting spray, and place a batting square on top of it. Press firmly so that your backing fabric isn’t wrinkled and the batting is well adhered to the fabric.\n\nDecide if you want the last, longest (14½”) log of your block to be a solid or plaid. Whichever fabric you decide, you will use for your first (center) block. (I plan to mix it up in my quilt!)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake a 2½” x 2½” square in the fabric you just chose (Fabric 1 for the rest of the instructions), place it right side up (the “soft” napped side, if you’re using single-nap flannel) in the center of your batting square, and quilt away! I like to quilt my center block in a spiral pattern. (I find that the flannel sticks nicely to the batting so that I don’t have to pin the logs down before stitching, but that’s up to you! I do try to keep the fabric smooth and steady.)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake a 2½” x 2½” square in the OTHER fabric you’re using for this block (Fabric 2) and place it on top of the square you just quilted, right (napped) sides together (RST). \n\nStitch the new log to the center block with a ¼” seam along the right edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOpen up the newly attached log and finger press or carefully press with an iron on low heat. (Be careful not to burn the batting!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_5.jpg)\n</p>\n\nQuilt the newly attached log. (I think straight-line quilting approximately ¼” apart and running the length of each log is probably the best and easiest choice!)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_6.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn your block a quarter-turn counterclockwise. Take a 4½” strip of Fabric 2 and place it on top of your first two logs, RST and having raw edges even.\n\nStitch the new log to the first two logs with a ¼” seam along the right edge.\n\nOpen up the newly attached log and finger press or carefully press with an iron on low heat.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_7.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_8.jpg)\n</p>\n\nQuilt away!\n\nTurn your block a quarter-turn counterclockwise and repeat the stitch-press open-quilt process with a 4½” strip of Fabric 1.\n\nAnd that’s it! Just keep turning your block a quarter-turn counterclockwise before adding the next log. You will finish with just one 14½” strip.\n\n#####Trimming Your Finished Blocks\nAfter you’ve quilted down your last (14½”) strip, it’s time to square up and trim your block! \n\nThe final size of your trimmed block will vary with your stitching accuracy. I love the quilt-as-you-go method because it’s very forgiving. If my seams aren’t a perfect ¼”, it’s not going to throw my entire project off. If my quilting or my strips get a little wonky, it’s OK. \n\nThat also means that my finished blocks are a little smaller than yours might be. The original tutorial I learned from results in 14½” x 14½” (trimmed) blocks, but mine ended up being 14” square after trimming. So measure your finished, untrimmed block and see what size you can trim down to. It will be between 14”- 14½”. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Pt 3](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_10.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSee you next week!\n\n#####The fabric.com Sew-Along Schedule\n* <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction (October 14): Join us for a fall sew-along</a>\n* <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 1 (October 21): Choosing fabrics and yardage requirements</a>\n* Week 2 (October 28): Cutting your fabric and quilt-as-you-go method overview\n* Week 3 (November 4): Sewing check-in—show us your progress!\n* Week 4 (November 11): Joining your blocks and binding your quilt\n\nBe sure to post your inspiration, fabric pulls, and progress on Instagram using the hashtag #fabriclogcabinsewalong. \n\nI love the quilt-as-you-go method because it’s very forgiving.

I like to quilt my center block in a spiral pattern. (I find that the flannel sticks nicely to the batting so that I don’t have to pin the logs down before stitching, but that’s up to you! I do try to keep the fabric smooth and steady.)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_3.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Pt 3\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Take a 2½” x 2½” square in the OTHER fabric you’re using for this block (Fabric 2) and place it on top of the square you just quilted, right (napped) sides together (RST). </p>\n\n<p>Stitch the new log to the center block with a ¼” seam along the right edge.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_4.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Pt 3\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Open up the newly attached log and finger press or carefully press with an iron on low heat.

Take a 4½” strip of Fabric 2 and place it on top of your first two logs, RST and having raw edges even.</p>\n\n<p>Stitch the new log to the first two logs with a ¼” seam along the right edge.</p>\n\n<p>Open up the newly attached log and finger press or carefully press with an iron on low heat.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_7.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Pt 3\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_8.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Pt 3\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Quilt away!</p>\n\n<p>Turn your block a quarter-turn counterclockwise and repeat the stitch-press open-quilt process with a 4½” strip of Fabric 1.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s it! Just keep turning your block a quarter-turn counterclockwise before adding the next log. You will finish with just one 14½” strip.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"trimmingyourfinishedblocks\">Trimming Your Finished Blocks</h5>\n\n<p>After you’ve quilted down your last (14½”) strip, it’s time to square up and trim your block! </p>\n\n<p>The final size of your trimmed block will vary with your stitching accuracy. I love the quilt-as-you-go method because it’s very forgiving. If my seams aren’t a perfect ¼”, it’s not going to throw my entire project off. If my quilting or my strips get a little wonky, it’s OK. </p>\n\n<p>That also means that my finished blocks are a little smaller than yours might be. The original tutorial I learned from results in 14½” x 14½” (trimmed) blocks, but mine ended up being 14” square after trimming. So measure your finished, untrimmed block and see what size you can trim down to. It will be between 14”- 14½”. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%203/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%202_post%20pic_10.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Pt 3\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>See you next week!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"thefabriccomsewalongschedule\">The fabric.com Sew-Along Schedule</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction (October 14): Join us for a fall sew-along</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Week 1 (October 21): Choosing fabrics and yardage requirements</a></li>\n<li>Week 2 (October 28): Cutting your fabric and quilt-as-you-go method overview</li>\n<li>Week 3 (November 4): Sewing check-in—show us your progress!</li>\n<li>Week 4 (November 11): Joining your blocks and binding your quilt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be sure to post your inspiration, fabric pulls, and progress on Instagram using the hashtag #fabriclogcabinsewalong. </p>\n\n<p>I love the quilt-as-you-go method because it’s very forgiving.

My beagle, Harper, has really been enjoying it...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_9900.JPG)\n</p>\n\nLet's get started!\n\nFirst and foremost, pre-wash both of your fabrics.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1863.JPG)\n</p>\n\nLay your flannel out so that you can see it all, and straighten out the cut edges by finding a line of plaid and cutting along that from selvedge to selvedge on each side. \n\nTrim your selvedge edges in this same way.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1879.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow, lay your Sherpa down (fuzzy side up), and lay your cut flannel piece on top of it. If the flannel is too large, you will have to cut it down some more. If not, you will have to trim your Sherpa to fit. With the Sherpa on the bottom and the flannel on the top, trim around to match the Sherpa to the flannel. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1870.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMake sure the sherpa’s selvedges (they resemble terry cloth) were cut off in this process. They should have been, but if they weren’t, trim to match. You should have two matching pieces of fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1880.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMake sure right sides are together (this flannel doesn’t have a wrong side, but the Sherpa does), and pin copiously. Pin around the edges every few inches and in the middle every few inches as well. We don’t want our fabrics to shift, and the Sherpa can be a little stretchy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1874.JPG)\n</p>\n\nOnce all your edges and middle are pinned, you can bring your blanket-in-progress over to your sewing machine. Starting around the middle of one edge at a 5/8” seam allowance, sew around each edge. \n\nWhen you get to a corner, stop about 5/8” from the edge, lower your needle, and pivot your blanket so that the next edge is now facing you. Continue sewing around the edge until you are about 5-10 inches from where you started. Backstitch (reverse your stitching for a few stitches) to secure your end. This is so you will have a place to turn your blanket right side out. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1881.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTrim all four corners so that your corners will be sharp when turned out. See how you’re almost to your corner when cutting? \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1883.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTurn your blanket right-side-out, making your corners as sharp as possible. Flatten your blanket so that the edges are even and smooth. \n\nIn the same way as we sewed the two pieces together, we are going to sew around the edges of the blanket to give it a nice finish. This time, turn your stitch length to 3.5 because we’re topstitching.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_1884.JPG)\n</p>\n\nWith a 5/8” seam allowance, stitch around all the sides. Start at the beginning of the opening and remove the pins as you go. Pivot at the corners as you did before. When you get back to where you started, backstitch, and you’re done!\n\nTrim any excess threads, and you have a cozy lap blanket that anyone would treasure.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sherpa Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sherpa%20Fleece%20Blanket/IMG_6981_edited.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n",

It may be fall, but this optimistic little panel adds a spot of brightness that is evergreen.\n\nThe finished size of this quilt is approximately 52” x 60”, a nice throw size. Use a ¼” seam allowance throughout.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Shibori Frames](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/nikkiQuiltFront.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the front of the quilt:\n\n####Prepare your fabrics \n\n* Cut (4) 8.5” x WOF (width of fabric) strips from your border fabric. \n* Sub-cut two of these into 8.5” x 36.5” strips. 36.5” is the panel measurement, so these will match those sides.\n* Cut the selvedges off the other two strips\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Shibori Frames](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1957.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut the selvedges off the panel. The panel’s sides and the two strips that the selvedges were removed from should now be the same length.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1952.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMake sure your panel edges are straight, if they aren’t, straighten them.\n\nWith the panel folded (selvedge edges together), place your acrylic ruler on the fold as close to the edge as possible, and cut off any excess. It should be a minute amount.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1954.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut your yellow corner fabric into one 8.5”x WOF strip. Sub-cut into (4) 8.5” squares.\n\n####Assemble your quilt top\nStitch the two 8.5”xWOF border strips onto each side of the panel (the WOF sides) with right sides together. Press the seam allowances towards the panel.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1961.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFor each 8.5”x36.5” strip, sew two of your yellow corner pieces onto the short side, right sides together, so they match. Press the seam allowances towards the yellow side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1959.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow sew these assembled strips (right sides together) onto the top and bottom of your panel. \n\nWith the way we pressed the seams, they should nest when sewing, like so:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1964.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSee how the borders on the side are pressed towards the panel, and the top border is pressed towards the yellow square? This means that the seam will almost click into place for a perfect seam at the corners.\n \nNow that your quilt top is assembled, press your remaining seams open. Pressing this way, with the borders so they nest, and the rest open, will reduce the bulkiness of the seams and make for easier quilting.\n\n####Assemble your backing\nI used a pieced backing to this quilt; you can do this many different ways, as long as your back is a bit longer and wider on each side than your top. \n\nCut each of your four fabrics into 30” x 34” rectangles (or you can just sew them all together without cutting and trim later when you’re basting your quilt).\n\nSew them in pairs, sewing one rectangle to the other, short ends and right sides together. Press these seams in opposite directions so they nest, and then sew the long sides together. Press this seam open.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_7072_edited.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Baste your quilt\nI won’t go into all the specifics of basting a quilt, there are many methods. My favorite is spray basting, which you can get on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Odif-Usa-Temporary-Fabric-Adhesive/dp/B0018N73C6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478615502&sr=8-1&keywords=spray+baste\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon </a>. It’s a little pricey, but it will last for a few quilts, and it’s so much faster.\n\nYou can also pin baste with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dritz-Quilting-Curved-Basting-75-Pack/dp/B001UAF6FI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1478615446&sr=8-2&keywords=basting+pins\" target=\"_blank\">curved basting pins</a>.  This is a rather slow method, but it’s a bit more stable and very tried and true. However, you have to stop as you quilt to remove them.\n\nOr, tack baste with a special <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-1270/quilt-basting-gun-with-500-fasteners?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-bright_side_quilt-_-tacking_gun\" target=\"_blank\">tacking gun</a>. They’re like the tacks you find on your clothes when you buy them that attach the price tags. A very handy tool and relatively inexpensive for how long it will last you.\n\nThe important part when basting is to make sure your batting is larger than your quilt top, and your back is larger than your batting. This will give you some wiggle room when quilting. The quilt “sandwich”, as it’s called goes quilt top, batting, and then backing. Make sure that the wrong sides of your back and top are facing the batting.\n\nYou can see here that the batting is larger than the top, and the back is larger than the batting, even though this is after quilting. See how the top has warped a little with the quilting? That’s why it’s important for the batting to be larger. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2008.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Quilt as desired\nYou can quilt this however you want. I used some random free motion quilting to go around the pretty words and flowers in the center of the panel and then used loopy free motion flowers around the rest of it.\n\nYou can also hand quilt, or use straight line quilting. Free motion quilting takes some special tools and a LOT of practice to get good at it, but its SUPER fast.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2007.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Square up your corners\nUsing a rotary cutter, mat, and ruler, trim the excess batting and backing.\n\nSquare up your corners, using the corner of your ruler and a rotary cutter.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2009.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Bind your quilt\nI decided to use a straight binding instead of a bias binding for this one. It’s faster and easier, and I haven’t had a problem with using a straight binding in terms of durability. If you prefer a bias binding, then make your bias binding as desired.\n\nFor a straight binding, cut (6) 2.5”xWOF strips from your light green binding fabric. Sew these together at the ends, right sides together, so that you have one very long 2.5” strip.\n\nBind your quilt in your favorite method. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2010.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI machine bound it by sewing it to the back with a ¼” seam allowance, and folding it over to the front to topstitch along the edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2021.JPG)\n</p>\n\nAnd you have a completed quilt! It’s so cheerful, and a nice size for curling up on the couch. It’s a constant source of optimism, and a reminder to always look on the bright side of life.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bright Side Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_7053_edited.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n\n",

Use a ¼” seam allowance throughout.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/nikkiQuiltFront.jpg\" alt=\"Shibori Frames\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For the front of the quilt:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"prepareyourfabrics\">Prepare your fabrics</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cut (4) 8.5” x WOF (width of fabric) strips from your border fabric. </li>\n<li>Sub-cut two of these into 8.5” x 36.5” strips. 36.5” is the panel measurement, so these will match those sides.</li>\n<li>Cut the selvedges off the other two strips</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1957.JPG\" alt=\"Shibori Frames\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Cut the selvedges off the panel. The panel’s sides and the two strips that the selvedges were removed from should now be the same length.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1952.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your panel edges are straight, if they aren’t, straighten them.</p>\n\n<p>With the panel folded (selvedge edges together), place your acrylic ruler on the fold as close to the edge as possible, and cut off any excess. It should be a minute amount.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1954.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Cut your yellow corner fabric into one 8.5”x WOF strip. Sub-cut into (4) 8.5” squares.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"assembleyourquilttop\">Assemble your quilt top</h4>\n\n<p>Stitch the two 8.5”xWOF border strips onto each side of the panel (the WOF sides) with right sides together. Press the seam allowances towards the panel.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1961.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For each 8.5”x36.5” strip, sew two of your yellow corner pieces onto the short side, right sides together, so they match. Press the seam allowances towards the yellow side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1959.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now sew these assembled strips (right sides together) onto the top and bottom of your panel. </p>\n\n<p>With the way we pressed the seams, they should nest when sewing, like so:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_1964.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>See how the borders on the side are pressed towards the panel, and the top border is pressed towards the yellow square? This means that the seam will almost click into place for a perfect seam at the corners.</p>\n\n<p>Now that your quilt top is assembled, press your remaining seams open. Pressing this way, with the borders so they nest, and the rest open, will reduce the bulkiness of the seams and make for easier quilting.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"assembleyourbacking\">Assemble your backing</h4>\n\n<p>I used a pieced backing to this quilt; you can do this many different ways, as long as your back is a bit longer and wider on each side than your top. </p>\n\n<p>Cut each of your four fabrics into 30” x 34” rectangles (or you can just sew them all together without cutting and trim later when you’re basting your quilt).</p>\n\n<p>Sew them in pairs, sewing one rectangle to the other, short ends and right sides together. Press these seams in opposite directions so they nest, and then sew the long sides together. Press this seam open.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_7072_edited.jpg\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"basteyourquilt\">Baste your quilt</h4>\n\n<p>I won’t go into all the specifics of basting a quilt, there are many methods. My favorite is spray basting, which you can get on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Odif-Usa-Temporary-Fabric-Adhesive/dp/B0018N73C6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478615502&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=spray+baste\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon </a>. It’s a little pricey, but it will last for a few quilts, and it’s so much faster.</p>\n\n<p>You can also pin baste with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dritz-Quilting-Curved-Basting-75-Pack/dp/B001UAF6FI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478615446&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=basting+pins\" target=\"_blank\">curved basting pins</a>.  This is a rather slow method, but it’s a bit more stable and very tried and true. However, you have to stop as you quilt to remove them.</p>\n\n<p>Or, tack baste with a special <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-1270/quilt-basting-gun-with-500-fasteners?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-bright_side_quilt-_-tacking_gun\" target=\"_blank\">tacking gun</a>. They’re like the tacks you find on your clothes when you buy them that attach the price tags. A very handy tool and relatively inexpensive for how long it will last you.</p>\n\n<p>The important part when basting is to make sure your batting is larger than your quilt top, and your back is larger than your batting. This will give you some wiggle room when quilting. The quilt “sandwich”, as it’s called goes quilt top, batting, and then backing. Make sure that the wrong sides of your back and top are facing the batting.</p>\n\n<p>You can see here that the batting is larger than the top, and the back is larger than the batting, even though this is after quilting. See how the top has warped a little with the quilting? That’s why it’s important for the batting to be larger. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2008.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"quiltasdesired\">Quilt as desired</h4>\n\n<p>You can quilt this however you want. I used some random free motion quilting to go around the pretty words and flowers in the center of the panel and then used loopy free motion flowers around the rest of it.</p>\n\n<p>You can also hand quilt, or use straight line quilting. Free motion quilting takes some special tools and a LOT of practice to get good at it, but its SUPER fast.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2007.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"squareupyourcorners\">Square up your corners</h4>\n\n<p>Using a rotary cutter, mat, and ruler, trim the excess batting and backing.</p>\n\n<p>Square up your corners, using the corner of your ruler and a rotary cutter.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2009.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bindyourquilt\">Bind your quilt</h4>\n\n<p>I decided to use a straight binding instead of a bias binding for this one. It’s faster and easier, and I haven’t had a problem with using a straight binding in terms of durability. If you prefer a bias binding, then make your bias binding as desired.</p>\n\n<p>For a straight binding, cut (6) 2.5”xWOF strips from your light green binding fabric. Sew these together at the ends, right sides together, so that you have one very long 2.5” strip.</p>\n\n<p>Bind your quilt in your favorite method. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2010.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I machine bound it by sewing it to the back with a ¼” seam allowance, and folding it over to the front to topstitch along the edges.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_2021.JPG\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>And you have a completed quilt! It’s so cheerful, and a nice size for curling up on the couch. It’s a constant source of optimism, and a reminder to always look on the bright side of life.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bright%20Side%20Quilt/IMG_7053_edited.jpg\" alt=\"Bright Side Quilt\" />\n</p>",

                        "markdown": "Created by: <a href=\"https://mywanderingpath.com/\" target=\"_blank\">My Wandering Path Blog</a>\n\nWelcome to Week 4 of the Fabric.com Log Cabin Sew-Along!\n\nWe’re nearing the end of our quilt-as-you-go sew-along. I hope you’ve been enjoying it! \n\nOver the past several weeks, we’ve gone from <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting our fabrics</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-2-cutting-and-sewing/\" target=\"_blank\">starting our log cabin blocks</a>. And now, hopefully, you’ve got a growing stack of quilted log cabin blocks that are ready to be joined into the rows of your blanket.\n\nThis week on the sew-along, I’m going to show you an easy way to join your lovely blocks with strips of contrasting sashing. (Just as there are several different ways to approach the quilt-as-you-go method, there are several different ways to join quilted blocks; I learned this approach from Michelle Patterns). \n\n####Contrast Sashing and Binding Cutting Instructions \nHere’s a tip: I found it easier to start by cutting the sashing strips first. Then I cut the remaining fabric on the bias for the binding. I’ll probably have a little extra binding leftover, which is never a bad thing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/table_week_4.png)\n</p>\n\n####Preparing the Sashing\nIt takes two sashing strips to join two blocks together: the 1” x block length strip will join the front of your blocks, while the 1.75” x block length strip will be used to join the back.\n\nStart by folding your back sashing strip in half across the length of the strip, wrong sides together and having raw edges even. Press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_1_with%20caption.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Joining Two Blocks\nThe first step is to sandwich the right edge of your first block between a front and back sashing strip.\n\nWith your first block right side up, place a front sashing strip along the right edge of the block, wrong side up (so the sashing and block are right sides together) and having raw edges even. Temporarily secure with a pin at the top and bottom of the block.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the block over and place a back sashing strip on the backside of your block, along the same edge and having raw edges even (so the folded edge of the strip is NOT along the raw edge of the block).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUse clips to secure the three layers and remove those temporary pins from the front of the block. (I think this works better than pins!)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_4.jpg)\n</p>\n\nStitch through the three layers along the raw edge using a ¼” seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_5.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow, press out the front sashing strip. Here I’ve pressed out the front sashing and have laid my second block next to the first to decide how I want to orient the next block:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_6.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the second block over to the left and align the right edge of the block with the right raw edge of the front sashing strip. The block and sashing should be right sides together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_7.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUse clips to secure the two layers and stitch along the raw edge using a ¼” seam. \n\nNow your two blocks are joined in the front by a narrow sashing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_8.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext we need to secure the back sashing. Here’s what the back will look like after you’ve finished stitching the front sashing:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_9.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress the back sashing over the space between the two blocks.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_10.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHandstitch the sashing to the back of your second block, just like you would handstitch a quilt binding.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_11.jpg)\n</p>\n\n(If you’d rather wait until you have all of the blocks for your row joined together before doing the handstitching, you can do that! You just have to make sure all your back sashings are stitched down before joining two completed rows together).\n\nAnd that’s it! You’ve joined two blocks together! Easy, right? \n\nI am loving how this dotted chambray sashing looks against the plaid flannel! What do you think?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_12.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAfter you’ve joined all your blocks into rows (you should have four rows of four blocks each), you’ll follow the same process to join the rows together.\n\nUse the bias cut strips to make the binding and bind your quilt using your preferred method.\n\nI’m still plugging away on my quilt-as-you-go log cabin blanket, but my kids have already started fighting over who gets to keep it! I can’t wait to show y’all the finished quilt. Stay tuned for the big reveal!\n\nHow are your quilts coming along? We would love to see your progress!

I hope you’ve been enjoying it! </p>\n\n<p>Over the past several weeks, we’ve gone from <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-1/\" target=\"_blank\">selecting our fabrics</a> to <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/log-cabin-blanket-sew-along-week-2-cutting-and-sewing/\" target=\"_blank\">starting our log cabin blocks</a>. And now, hopefully, you’ve got a growing stack of quilted log cabin blocks that are ready to be joined into the rows of your blanket.</p>\n\n<p>This week on the sew-along, I’m going to show you an easy way to join your lovely blocks with strips of contrasting sashing. (Just as there are several different ways to approach the quilt-as-you-go method, there are several different ways to join quilted blocks; I learned this approach from Michelle Patterns). </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"contrastsashingandbindingcuttinginstructions\">Contrast Sashing and Binding Cutting Instructions</h4>\n\n<p>Here’s a tip: I found it easier to start by cutting the sashing strips first. Then I cut the remaining fabric on the bias for the binding. I’ll probably have a little extra binding leftover, which is never a bad thing!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/table_week_4.png\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"preparingthesashing\">Preparing the Sashing</h4>\n\n<p>It takes two sashing strips to join two blocks together: the 1” x block length strip will join the front of your blocks, while the 1.75” x block length strip will be used to join the back.</p>\n\n<p>Start by folding your back sashing strip in half across the length of the strip, wrong sides together and having raw edges even. Press.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_1_with%20caption.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"joiningtwoblocks\">Joining Two Blocks</h4>\n\n<p>The first step is to sandwich the right edge of your first block between a front and back sashing strip.</p>\n\n<p>With your first block right side up, place a front sashing strip along the right edge of the block, wrong side up (so the sashing and block are right sides together) and having raw edges even. Temporarily secure with a pin at the top and bottom of the block.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_2.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Flip the block over and place a back sashing strip on the backside of your block, along the same edge and having raw edges even (so the folded edge of the strip is NOT along the raw edge of the block).</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_3.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Use clips to secure the three layers and remove those temporary pins from the front of the block. (I think this works better than pins!)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_4.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Stitch through the three layers along the raw edge using a ¼” seam. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_5.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now, press out the front sashing strip. Here I’ve pressed out the front sashing and have laid my second block next to the first to decide how I want to orient the next block:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_6.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Flip the second block over to the left and align the right edge of the block with the right raw edge of the front sashing strip. The block and sashing should be right sides together.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_7.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Use clips to secure the two layers and stitch along the raw edge using a ¼” seam. </p>\n\n<p>Now your two blocks are joined in the front by a narrow sashing!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_8.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Next we need to secure the back sashing. Here’s what the back will look like after you’ve finished stitching the front sashing:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_9.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Press the back sashing over the space between the two blocks.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_10.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Handstitch the sashing to the back of your second block, just like you would handstitch a quilt binding.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_11.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>(If you’d rather wait until you have all of the blocks for your row joined together before doing the handstitching, you can do that! You just have to make sure all your back sashings are stitched down before joining two completed rows together).</p>\n\n<p>And that’s it! You’ve joined two blocks together! Easy, right? </p>\n\n<p>I am loving how this dotted chambray sashing looks against the plaid flannel! What do you think?</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Log%20Cabin%20Sew%20Along%20Pt%205/Fabriclogcabinsewalong_Week%204_post%20pic_12.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>After you’ve joined all your blocks into rows (you should have four rows of four blocks each), you’ll follow the same process to join the rows together.</p>\n\n<p>Use the bias cut strips to make the binding and bind your quilt using your preferred method.</p>\n\n<p>I’m still plugging away on my quilt-as-you-go log cabin blanket, but my kids have already started fighting over who gets to keep it! I can’t wait to show y’all the finished quilt. Stay tuned for the big reveal!</p>\n\n<p>How are your quilts coming along? We would love to see your progress!

The weave is far too loose, and you would end up with an unraveled mess!\n\nOn one cut edge of your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-all_burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a>, snip into the selvedge with your scissors next to one of the threads so that you can get to that thread easier.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1907.JPG)\n</p>\n\nPull on that thread you “freed” gently, gathering across the width of the burlap, until you’ve pulled the whole thread out of the fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1909.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow you’ve left a little channel running from selvedge to selvedge. If your channel doesn’t run the whole width of the fabric, you’ll need to pick a spot further in.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1912.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut down this channel so you have a nice, even edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1913.JPG)\n</p>\n\nRepeat on the other side, picking a spot that will give you the perfect length for your table runner. I aim for about 1 foot of overhang on each side of your table.\n\nNext, trim the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-all_burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> to be about 13” by the length you’ve just cut. This gives you A LOT of extra burlap, but we needed it to get the length of the table. I started at the selvedge, and marked 13 inches from that.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1915.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut off the denser selvedge edge very carefully, following one thread the entire way. This is like what we did with pulling the thread, which you can do, but I find it simpler to cut it the whole way when we’re working with such a long length. Repeat at your 13” marking as well. Now you’ll have a very long 13” wide strip of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-all_burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a>!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1917.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow we do some fun unraveling. Starting on the long sides, pull out each thread all the way down, so that you’re creating a fringe. Stop when you achieve your desired look. I stopped at ½” for the sides, since our ends will have a much longer fringe.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1921.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\nRepeat for the short ends. This time, I created a super long fringe (5”), so that we can make tassels out of it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1924.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\nTo make the tassels, grab about 10 of those strings at a time. Some of mine were less than ten to even out the size of them, since I didn’t have multiples of ten. Play it by ear.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1927.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow make a simple knot right where your fringe begins.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1928.JPG)\n</p>\n\nRepeat until all of your fringe has been tasseled, and you are finished!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1930.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/christmasTable16b_square.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Classic Mitered Corner Linen Napkins\nTo make these classic napkins, all you need is a half yard of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0439817/telio-washed-linen-oatmeal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-linen\" target=\"_blank\">linen</a> for 3 napkins, so determine how many napkins you want, and add ½ yard for safety and shrinkage.\n\nEach napkin will start out as 18”x18” squares, so cut out as many as you want to make. I made 8 napkins total for 8 standard place settings, but you can make as any or as few as you like.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/christmasTable1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOne tip for these- don’t estimate, measure exactly for the most accurate results.\nFor each napkin, fold over ½” on each side and press for a nice crease.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1938.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow fold over another half an inch so that is enclosed, and press again.\nUnfold so that you have only one fold on all sides.\n\nAt each corner, make a mark like so, keeping it at a right angle and not going over the folded edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1940.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFold your napkin at the corner, right sides together, so that you can see the marking on one side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1941.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSew along that line, and trim the excess. Repeat for all four corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1943.JPG)\n</p>\n\nWhen you turn this out, you will have a perfect mitered corner! Pin these edges down.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1945.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSew along this edge about 1/8” from the fold for a lovely finish.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1946.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow, fold as desired and add them to your gorgeous Holiday tablescape.  Add some greenery and your favorite festive dishes for a welcoming holiday scene! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew Along Week 4](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/christmasTable7.jpg)\n</p>\n\n",

If your channel doesn’t run the whole width of the fabric, you’ll need to pick a spot further in.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1912.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Cut down this channel so you have a nice, even edge.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1913.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Repeat on the other side, picking a spot that will give you the perfect length for your table runner. I aim for about 1 foot of overhang on each side of your table.</p>\n\n<p>Next, trim the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-all_burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> to be about 13” by the length you’ve just cut. This gives you A LOT of extra burlap, but we needed it to get the length of the table. I started at the selvedge, and marked 13 inches from that.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1915.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Cut off the denser selvedge edge very carefully, following one thread the entire way. This is like what we did with pulling the thread, which you can do, but I find it simpler to cut it the whole way when we’re working with such a long length. Repeat at your 13” marking as well. Now you’ll have a very long 13” wide strip of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-all_burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a>!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1917.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now we do some fun unraveling. Starting on the long sides, pull out each thread all the way down, so that you’re creating a fringe. Stop when you achieve your desired look. I stopped at ½” for the sides, since our ends will have a much longer fringe.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1921.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Repeat for the short ends. This time, I created a super long fringe (5”), so that we can make tassels out of it.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1924.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>To make the tassels, grab about 10 of those strings at a time. Some of mine were less than ten to even out the size of them, since I didn’t have multiples of ten. Play it by ear.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1927.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now make a simple knot right where your fringe begins.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1928.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Repeat until all of your fringe has been tasseled, and you are finished!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1930.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/christmasTable16b_square.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"classicmiteredcornerlinennapkins\">Classic Mitered Corner Linen Napkins</h4>\n\n<p>To make these classic napkins, all you need is a half yard of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0439817/telio-washed-linen-oatmeal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-holiday_runner_and_napkins-_-linen\" target=\"_blank\">linen</a> for 3 napkins, so determine how many napkins you want, and add ½ yard for safety and shrinkage.</p>\n\n<p>Each napkin will start out as 18”x18” squares, so cut out as many as you want to make. I made 8 napkins total for 8 standard place settings, but you can make as any or as few as you like.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/christmasTable1.jpg\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>One tip for these- don’t estimate, measure exactly for the most accurate results. <br />\nFor each napkin, fold over ½” on each side and press for a nice crease.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1938.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now fold over another half an inch so that is enclosed, and press again. <br />\nUnfold so that you have only one fold on all sides.</p>\n\n<p>At each corner, make a mark like so, keeping it at a right angle and not going over the folded edges.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1940.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Fold your napkin at the corner, right sides together, so that you can see the marking on one side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Burlap%20Table%20Runner%20and%20Napkins/IMG_1941.JPG\" alt=\"Sew Along Week 4\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew along that line, and trim the excess.

You see it used with skirts, shoes, dresses, blazers, etc. and I just can’t get enough! Fabric.com has a fabulous selection of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=velvet&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-stretch_velvet\" target=\"_blank\">stretch velvets</a>, and I’m here to show you how to use them!\n\nI love <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=velvet&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-stretch_velvet\" target=\"_blank\">stretch velvet</a> because it’s not very complicated to use. Basically, think of it as a knit fabric. The only thing you need to be aware of is the nap. When you pet the fabric, you can feel the fabric laying smoothly one way, and pushing against your hand (a little rough) the other way. With stretch velvet, you have to decide which way you want the nap to go for your project, the light hits it differently both ways. For this project, I decided to go against the nap. \n\n I recently came across a <a href=\"http://ullajohnson.com/products/paulina-dress?variant=24073630022\" target=\"_blank\">boho designer dress</a> made in a stunning yellow velvet, and the rest was history. I knew I had to make my own version of the eye catching frock. I really love the different design elements to this dress, specifically its yokes, gathered waist and tiered prairie style skirt.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/Paulina_Mulberry-Alt.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI have a really fun tutorial planned for you that will walk you through how to make and draft your own pattern for this dress as well as a sew-along that take you through the entire process of sewing your dress together. Let’s get started!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3977.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Materials:\n* 3-4 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=velvet&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-stretch_velvet\" target=\"_blank\">velvet fabric</a> (Make your pattern pieces first to decide how much you will need- for me making a size Small, I need about 3 ½ yards)\n* About 4 yds of Cording (I used <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/263944742/3mm-round-suede-cord-natural-choose-your?ref=shop_home_active_85\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>). \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0372043/braided-elastic-1-4x8yd-white?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-elastic\" target=\"_blank\">1/4\" elastic</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns-thread.aspx?fiber-content-range=polyester-or-polyester-blends&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-polyester_thread\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester thread</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-309/schmetz-ball-point-machine-needle-assortment?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-ball_point_needle\" target=\"_blank\">Ball Point Needle</a>\n* <a href=\"https://shop.deer-and-doe.fr/en/sewing-patterns/20-plantain-t-shirt-pattern.html\" target=\"_blank\">Plantain tee pattern</a> by Deer and Doe (it’s free!) \n* <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Pattern-Paper-Patternmaking-Drafting/dp/B007AH74VO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479272801&sr=8-1&keywords=medical+exam+paper\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern paper</a> or white computer paper can work too \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rulers&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_velvet_dress-_-ruler\" target=\"_blank\">Ruler</a>\n* Clear tape\n* Fitted t shirt you already own for reference\n\n####Creating your pattern:\n1) First of all, print out your Deer and Doe Plantain Tee pattern, and tape it together according to your size. You will need pieces 1,2 and 4.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3239.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\n\n2) Grab your fitted t-shirt (a crew neck or slightly lower neckline you like is best). The plantain tee pattern has a really low neckline, so we are going to use this t-shirt to draw a new, higher neckline. \n\n3) To get started, tape a blank sheet of paper or tracing paper under the neckline area of both your front and back bodice pattern pieces. \n\n4) Fold your t-shirt in half long ways, with the front side out. Lay it on top of your bodice front pattern piece, lining up the shoulder edges. \n\n5) Mark the new neckline according to your t-shirt. We will be adding another ½” to the neckline with your neckband, so keep this in mind as you are drawing your new neckline. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3244.JPG)\n</p>\n\n6) Trace and mark the neckline of your t-shirt to the shoulder seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3246.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3247.JPG)\n</p>\n\n7) Before moving your T-shirt off the pattern, trace along the side seam of your t-shirt as well, marking it straight onto the plantain shirt pattern. (We’re basically making a pattern block). Add an additional ½” grading down from the underarm seam to add your seam allowance along the side seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2838%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3248.JPG)\n</p>\n\n8) Cut along these new lines we just drew. Mine are all in red. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3251.JPG)\n</p>\n\n9) Repeat for your back bodice, but this time only tracing the side seams (don’t worry about the back neckline, it’s already high enough). I also did not add seam allowances to my back bodice, it ends up being wide enough as it is that you don’t need to add them. \n\n10) Now we are going to make our front and back yokes. Take your front bodice pattern, and measure down from your mid top shoulder seam to mid armhole (6 1/8” for me), and mark this measurement on your pattern mid armhole. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3252.JPG)\n</p>\n\n11) Draw a line from this marking we just made to the center front of your bodice, make sure it’s exactly straight from your armhole measurement to the center front. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3253.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3254.JPG)\n</p>\n\n12) Cut along this line. Add ½” seam allowance along both the yoke and new bodice edge.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2837%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3255.JPG)\n</p>\n\n13) Repeat for back yoke and bodice. (steps 10-12). Label front and back yoke piece, we will cutting one front yoke and one back yoke on the fold. \n\n14) It is important in pattern making to true your patterns. To do this, lay the front and back yokes on top of each other, and make sure they are the same. I had to add a little to one piece and subtract a little from the other. Do the same for you bodice front and back pieces too. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2836%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n15) Now find your waist measurement, and mark it on your front and back bodice pieces. Lay them on top of each other and make sure these measurements are exactly the same for both pieces so your casing will line up correctly along the side seams when sewn together. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/waist.jpg)\n</p>\n\n16) Now we are going to apply a method called slash and spread to our front and back bodice pieces. This allows us to add extra fullness to this pattern piece. We are going to be slashing and spreading these pieces by 1.5 for equal fullness. So to figure out how to do this we need to make a few quick calculations, it’s really quite simple!\n\na. Total Waist Measurement x 1.5=  Added Fullness Measurement (ex: 32 X 1.5=48)\nb. Added Fullness Measurement / 4 = How much fullness we are adding (ex: 48 /4=12)\nc. How Much Added Fullness / 4 pieces= total amount we need to add to F and B bodice pieces (ex: 12/4= 4” needed per piece).\n\n17) To figure out how to space your slash and spread pieces, calculate:\n\na. Front Bodice Waist Measurement / Fullness to Add= Spacing.\nb. Ex: 8 ¼ / 4”= 2” Spread\n\n18) Mark this spacing measurement along your bodice piece. So I marked every 2” and then drew a perpendicular line to the top of my bodice piece. (photo: fullsizerender(45) ). \n19) Next, we are going to cut along these lines one at a time. On tracing paper draw a straight horizontal line along the bottom as a reference. Cut along your spacing lines one at a time. So cut, tape, measure 1”. Repeat adding 4 “ total. It will look like this once finished. Label your pattern piece, we will cut one on the fold for each Front and Back piece. Draw a horizontal line along your waist measurement we previously marked. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3264.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3265.JPG)\n</p>\n\n20) Repeat for back bodice (steps 16-19). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2844%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n21) Now we need to add the first section of our skirt, and we are going to add it directly to the front and back bodice pieces to make one whole piece. Using a tape measure, measure from your waist to about mid thigh. I’m 5’4”and it ended up being 16” for me. \n\n22) Tape your Front and Back bodice pieces to tracing paper along the bottom edge. Draw a line from the side and center front seams using this new measurement we just made. (Mine was 16”) and make the width the same as your bodice piece. Add ½” seam allowance along the side seam for both pieces. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](http://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3298.JPG)\n</p>\n\na. Label your pattern pieces; we will cut one Front bodice on the fold and one Back bodice on the fold. \n\n23) Now we are going to make the last two tiers of our dress. \n\nLength wise I decided I wanted my tiers to be: tier 1:  6” and tier 2: 5 ½” when finished. Don’t forget to add 1” for seam allowance to your length. Here’s how to figure this out:\n\na. Tier 1: Waist Measurement x 2.7 / 2 = width x desired length. (ex: 40” width x 7” length)\nb. Tier 2: Waist Measurement x 4 / 2= width x desired length + 1” for hem). (ex: 56” width x 7.5” length) \nc. Draw out these two pieces, label each pattern piece, we will cut one of each tier on the fold. \n\n24) Almost there guys! I promise it’s worth it! Just a few more pieces to go. Next, we need to make our casing piece. This will go right along our waist on both front and back bodice pieces. So here is how you calculate this pattern piece:\n\na. Measure across the waistline on your pattern that we marked. \nb. Subtract 1 ½” from this measurement = (casing pattern width x 1 ¼” length) \nc. Mine ended up being 11” x 1 ¼” \nd. Draw this pattern piece (a rectangle). \ne. Repeat for back bodice piece. Label this pattern piece, we will cut one on the fold for the front and one on the fold for the back. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2843%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n25) Now our neckband pattern piece (another rectangle):\n\na. Using a tape measure, measure along your front and back neckline on your yoke pattern pieces. Multiply each measurement by 2 since we are only measuring half of each neckline. I ended up with 23”.  (13” Front and 10” for back)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3287%20%281%29.JPG)\n</p>\n\nb. Subtract 4” from your total measurement. Ex: 23” -4”= 19”. Divide this number by 2 to get you neckband width and add ½” for seam allowance. (ex: 9.5 + ½” x 2” length)\nc. Draw this pattern piece out using a flat ruler. Label, we will cut one on the fold.\n \n26) Last but not least, the sleeves! Using the plantain shirt sleeve pattern, we are just going to make a few quick adjustments. This pattern is a for a fitted long sleeve. First, find your desired sleeve length, plus 1” for the hem and adjust your pattern accordingly. I wanted my sleeve to be 16” long, so I measured from the top middle of the sleeve to 17” down and drew a horizontal line, and cut.\n \n27) Next we need to add ½” to either side of the sleeve, grading from the underarm edge to the hem of the sleeve. Tape some tracing paper along each side of your sleeve, and add ½”. Label your pattern pieces, we will cut two. \n\nPhew! You made it! Now, for the fun part!\n\n####Sewing your dress:\nBefore cutting out your pattern, find the direction of the nap you like best, and make sure to cut your patterns out in this direction so they all look the same when sewn together, there is a big difference in the way the light hits velvet. I decided to cut against the nap. \n\nCut out your pattern pieces according to your labels you marked on your pattern pieces. \nBefore we begin sewing, make sure to use a ballpoint needle with a zig zag or lightning stitch unless otherwise mentioned.\n \nWhen it comes to ironing this fabric, we won’t be ironing very much. Put your iron on it’s lowest setting and hold your iron about ½” away from the fabric and just steam. If you over steam with the iron placed directly on your fabric, it may discolor your fabric slightly. So be careful! I did lightly touch my iron to the side seams and casing. When doing this make sure to place a towel underneath your fabric so as not to crush your velvet. \n\n#####Let’s put it all together!\n\n1) First we are going to attach our casing to our front and back bodice pieces. Mark your waistline previously marked on your pattern along the front and back waist marking. I used pins to mark this line on my fabric.\n \n2) Lightly fold and iron both ends of casing pieces in at ½” wrong sides together. Top stitch to finish this edge. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3325.JPG)\n</p>\n\n3) Now, fold both long edges on each casing piece in at ¼” on each side wrong sides together, lightly iron. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3326.JPG)\n</p>\n\n4) Line up your prepped casing along the pins marking your waist on your front and back bodice pieces. Pin in place. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3333.JPG)\n</p>\n\n5) Topstitch 1/8” away on either side of casing, leaving ends open. (Make sure to use a straight stitch) \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3350.JPG)\n</p>\n\n6) Along the top of your front bodice piece, sew basting stitches at ¼” and ½”, leave long tails on either end. \n\n7) Gather along this top edge, lightly pulling your threads, and match up to your front yoke piece. Make sure to evenly spread your gathers. Before gathering I like to match up the centers of both pieces, and ends, (right sides together) pinning in place. Then I gather my long edge to fit. Either way works. \n\n8) Sew the bottom of the yoke and top of front bodice pieces right side together at ½” using a zig zag or lightning stitch. Remove any basting stitches you can see on the right side.\n\n9) Repeat for back bodice and yoke. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2842%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n10) Now we are going to sew tier one to the bottom of our front bodice piece. Again, sew basting stitched to the top of your tier one piece at ¼” and ½”. Pin the pieces together RST at centers and ends, lightly pull threads to gather the long tier one edge to fit the bottom of your front bodice edge. Pin, and sew ½” with a stretch stitch, and remove any visible basting stitches on front side. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3348.JPG)\n</p>\n\n11) Repeat for Back Bodice.\n\n12) Next we will sew our final tier, tier 2 to the bottom of tier one. Again, sew basting stitches at ¼” and ½” along the top of tier two. Match center and ends for both pieces, lightly pull threads and evenly space gathers to fit, pin in place. Sew at ½” using a stretch stitch, remove any visible threads on the right side. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3351.JPG)\n</p>\n\n13) Repeat for back bodice. \n\n14) Next we need to sew our shoulder seams together. Pin front and back shoulders right sides together. Sew at ½” using a stretch stitch: zig zag or lightening stitch. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2841%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n15) Now it’s time to sew in our sleeves. We are going to pin our sleeve cap into the armhole, right sides together. Match up your corners at the end of your cap and armhole, and the center of your sleeve to the shoulder seam. Sew at ½”using a stretch stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3359.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3357.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3358.JPG)\n</p>\n\n16) With right sides facing, pin your side seams and sleeves together from sleeve hem to dress hem on both sides of your dress. Sew each side at ½”, with a stretch stitch. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3360.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3361.JPG)\n</p>\n \n17) Almost done! Now let’s finish our neckline. Fold your neckline band in half along the fold, right sides together. Sew at ½”. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2846%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3433.JPG)\n</p>\n \n18) Now fold your neckband piece in half wrong sides together and pin in place instead of ironing. \n\n19) Using pins, mark the front, back and sides of your neckband, quartering it. This helps keep it even when pinning it to the neckline. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2840%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n20) Pin your neck band to your neckline, right sides together, pinning first at shoulder seams and front and back centers. Lightly stretch your neck band (not your neckline) to fit and pin the rest of your neckband in place. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2839%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew at ½” using a stretch stitch. Trim your seam allowance, and topstitch along the neckline to keep the seam allowance laying down. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3439.JPG)\n</p>\n\n21) Now let’s hem our sleeve. Wrap your ¼” elastic around where your sleeve will end along your arm to where it’s just fitted, and cut two pieces to this length.\n \n22) Using my fingers and no iron, I folded each sleeve end in at ¼” and then ½”. Pin this in place. Edgestitch around your casing using a straight stitch, making sure to leave about ½” opening to insert your elastic. Repeat for your other sleeve. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3443.JPG)\n</p>\n\n23) Attach a safety pin to one end of your elastic, and insert it into your sleeve casing. Sew your two elastic ends together (make sure there’s no twisting inside your sleeve casing before sewing). Push the elastic into your casing completely, and edgestitch your opening closed. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3446.JPG)\n</p>\n\n24) Hem the bottom of your dress. Again, using my fingers, I folded my hem at ¼” and then ½” and pinned in place all the way around. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3440.JPG)\n</p>\n\nEdgestitch using a straight stitch\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3441.JPG)\n</p>\n\n25) Cut your cording in half exactly and insert your cording into your waist casing. Insert each piece like the letter U into each side, so two ends come out on each side. Tie a little knot at the end of your cording once it is inserted. \n\nYou did it! I hope you enjoy your new dress! Thanks for following along! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3980.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Velvet](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3979.JPG)\n</p>\n",

You see it used with skirts, shoes, dresses, blazers, etc. and I just can’t get enough!

Basically, think of it as a knit fabric. The only thing you need to be aware of is the nap. When you pet the fabric, you can feel the fabric laying smoothly one way, and pushing against your hand (a little rough) the other way. With stretch velvet, you have to decide which way you want the nap to go for your project, the light hits it differently both ways. For this project, I decided to go against the nap. </p>\n\n<p>I recently came across a <a href=\"http://ullajohnson.com/products/paulina-dress?variant=24073630022\" target=\"_blank\">boho designer dress</a> made in a stunning yellow velvet, and the rest was history.

You will need pieces 1,2 and 4.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3239.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>2) Grab your fitted t-shirt (a crew neck or slightly lower neckline you like is best). The plantain tee pattern has a really low neckline, so we are going to use this t-shirt to draw a new, higher neckline. </p>\n\n<p>3) To get started, tape a blank sheet of paper or tracing paper under the neckline area of both your front and back bodice pattern pieces. </p>\n\n<p>4) Fold your t-shirt in half long ways, with the front side out. Lay it on top of your bodice front pattern piece, lining up the shoulder edges. </p>\n\n<p>5) Mark the new neckline according to your t-shirt. We will be adding another ½” to the neckline with your neckband, so keep this in mind as you are drawing your new neckline. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3244.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>6) Trace and mark the neckline of your t-shirt to the shoulder seam. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3246.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3247.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>7) Before moving your T-shirt off the pattern, trace along the side seam of your t-shirt as well, marking it straight onto the plantain shirt pattern. (We’re basically making a pattern block). Add an additional ½” grading down from the underarm seam to add your seam allowance along the side seam. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2838%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3248.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>8) Cut along these new lines we just drew. Mine are all in red. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3251.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>9) Repeat for your back bodice, but this time only tracing the side seams (don’t worry about the back neckline, it’s already high enough). I also did not add seam allowances to my back bodice, it ends up being wide enough as it is that you don’t need to add them. </p>\n\n<p>10) Now we are going to make our front and back yokes. Take your front bodice pattern, and measure down from your mid top shoulder seam to mid armhole (6 1/8” for me), and mark this measurement on your pattern mid armhole. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3252.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>11) Draw a line from this marking we just made to the center front of your bodice, make sure it’s exactly straight from your armhole measurement to the center front. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3253.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3254.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>12) Cut along this line. Add ½” seam allowance along both the yoke and new bodice edge.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2837%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3255.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>13) Repeat for back yoke and bodice. (steps 10-12). Label front and back yoke piece, we will cutting one front yoke and one back yoke on the fold. </p>\n\n<p>14) It is important in pattern making to true your patterns. To do this, lay the front and back yokes on top of each other, and make sure they are the same. I had to add a little to one piece and subtract a little from the other. Do the same for you bodice front and back pieces too. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2836%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>15) Now find your waist measurement, and mark it on your front and back bodice pieces. Lay them on top of each other and make sure these measurements are exactly the same for both pieces so your casing will line up correctly along the side seams when sewn together. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/waist.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>16) Now we are going to apply a method called slash and spread to our front and back bodice pieces. This allows us to add extra fullness to this pattern piece. We are going to be slashing and spreading these pieces by 1.5 for equal fullness. So to figure out how to do this we need to make a few quick calculations, it’s really quite simple!</p>\n\n<p>a. Total Waist Measurement x 1.5=  Added Fullness Measurement (ex: 32 X 1.5=48) <br />\nb. Added Fullness Measurement / 4 = How much fullness we are adding (ex: 48 /4=12) <br />\nc. How Much Added Fullness / 4 pieces= total amount we need to add to F and B bodice pieces (ex: 12/4= 4” needed per piece).</p>\n\n<p>17) To figure out how to space your slash and spread pieces, calculate:</p>\n\n<p>a. Front Bodice Waist Measurement / Fullness to Add= Spacing. <br />\nb. Ex: 8 ¼ / 4”= 2” Spread</p>\n\n<p>18) Mark this spacing measurement along your bodice piece. So I marked every 2” and then drew a perpendicular line to the top of my bodice piece. (photo: fullsizerender(45) ). <br />\n19) Next, we are going to cut along these lines one at a time. On tracing paper draw a straight horizontal line along the bottom as a reference. Cut along your spacing lines one at a time. So cut, tape, measure 1”. Repeat adding 4 “ total. It will look like this once finished. Label your pattern piece, we will cut one on the fold for each Front and Back piece. Draw a horizontal line along your waist measurement we previously marked. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3264.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3265.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>20) Repeat for back bodice (steps 16-19). </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2844%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>21) Now we need to add the first section of our skirt, and we are going to add it directly to the front and back bodice pieces to make one whole piece. Using a tape measure, measure from your waist to about mid thigh. I’m 5’4”and it ended up being 16” for me. </p>\n\n<p>22) Tape your Front and Back bodice pieces to tracing paper along the bottom edge. Draw a line from the side and center front seams using this new measurement we just made. (Mine was 16”) and make the width the same as your bodice piece. Add ½” seam allowance along the side seam for both pieces. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"http://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3298.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>a. Label your pattern pieces; we will cut one Front bodice on the fold and one Back bodice on the fold. </p>\n\n<p>23) Now we are going to make the last two tiers of our dress. </p>\n\n<p>Length wise I decided I wanted my tiers to be: tier 1:  6” and tier 2: 5 ½” when finished. Don’t forget to add 1” for seam allowance to your length. Here’s how to figure this out:</p>\n\n<p>a. Tier 1: Waist Measurement x 2.7 / 2 = width x desired length. (ex: 40” width x 7” length) <br />\nb. Tier 2: Waist Measurement x 4 / 2= width x desired length + 1” for hem). (ex: 56” width x 7.5” length) <br />\nc. Draw out these two pieces, label each pattern piece, we will cut one of each tier on the fold. </p>\n\n<p>24) Almost there guys! I promise it’s worth it! Just a few more pieces to go. Next, we need to make our casing piece. This will go right along our waist on both front and back bodice pieces. So here is how you calculate this pattern piece:</p>\n\n<p>a. Measure across the waistline on your pattern that we marked. <br />\nb. Subtract 1 ½” from this measurement = (casing pattern width x 1 ¼” length) <br />\nc. Mine ended up being 11” x 1 ¼” <br />\nd. Draw this pattern piece (a rectangle). <br />\ne. Repeat for back bodice piece. Label this pattern piece, we will cut one on the fold for the front and one on the fold for the back. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2843%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>25) Now our neckband pattern piece (another rectangle):</p>\n\n<p>a. Using a tape measure, measure along your front and back neckline on your yoke pattern pieces. Multiply each measurement by 2 since we are only measuring half of each neckline. I ended up with 23”.  (13” Front and 10” for back)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3287%20%281%29.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>b. Subtract 4” from your total measurement. Ex: 23” -4”= 19”. Divide this number by 2 to get you neckband width and add ½” for seam allowance. (ex: 9.5 + ½” x 2” length) <br />\nc. Draw this pattern piece out using a flat ruler. Label, we will cut one on the fold.</p>\n\n<p>26) Last but not least, the sleeves! Using the plantain shirt sleeve pattern, we are just going to make a few quick adjustments. This pattern is a for a fitted long sleeve. First, find your desired sleeve length, plus 1” for the hem and adjust your pattern accordingly. I wanted my sleeve to be 16” long, so I measured from the top middle of the sleeve to 17” down and drew a horizontal line, and cut.</p>\n\n<p>27) Next we need to add ½” to either side of the sleeve, grading from the underarm edge to the hem of the sleeve. Tape some tracing paper along each side of your sleeve, and add ½”. Label your pattern pieces, we will cut two. </p>\n\n<p>Phew! You made it! Now, for the fun part!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewingyourdress\">Sewing your dress:</h4>\n\n<p>Before cutting out your pattern, find the direction of the nap you like best, and make sure to cut your patterns out in this direction so they all look the same when sewn together, there is a big difference in the way the light hits velvet. I decided to cut against the nap. </p>\n\n<p>Cut out your pattern pieces according to your labels you marked on your pattern pieces. <br />\nBefore we begin sewing, make sure to use a ballpoint needle with a zig zag or lightning stitch unless otherwise mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to ironing this fabric, we won’t be ironing very much. Put your iron on it’s lowest setting and hold your iron about ½” away from the fabric and just steam. If you over steam with the iron placed directly on your fabric, it may discolor your fabric slightly. So be careful! I did lightly touch my iron to the side seams and casing. When doing this make sure to place a towel underneath your fabric so as not to crush your velvet. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"letsputitalltogether\">Let’s put it all together!</h5>\n\n<p>1) First we are going to attach our casing to our front and back bodice pieces. Mark your waistline previously marked on your pattern along the front and back waist marking. I used pins to mark this line on my fabric.</p>\n\n<p>2) Lightly fold and iron both ends of casing pieces in at ½” wrong sides together. Top stitch to finish this edge. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3325.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>3) Now, fold both long edges on each casing piece in at ¼” on each side wrong sides together, lightly iron. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3326.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>4) Line up your prepped casing along the pins marking your waist on your front and back bodice pieces. Pin in place. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3333.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>5) Topstitch 1/8” away on either side of casing, leaving ends open. (Make sure to use a straight stitch) </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3350.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>6) Along the top of your front bodice piece, sew basting stitches at ¼” and ½”, leave long tails on either end. </p>\n\n<p>7) Gather along this top edge, lightly pulling your threads, and match up to your front yoke piece. Make sure to evenly spread your gathers. Before gathering I like to match up the centers of both pieces, and ends, (right sides together) pinning in place. Then I gather my long edge to fit. Either way works. </p>\n\n<p>8) Sew the bottom of the yoke and top of front bodice pieces right side together at ½” using a zig zag or lightning stitch. Remove any basting stitches you can see on the right side.</p>\n\n<p>9) Repeat for back bodice and yoke. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2842%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>10) Now we are going to sew tier one to the bottom of our front bodice piece. Again, sew basting stitched to the top of your tier one piece at ¼” and ½”. Pin the pieces together RST at centers and ends, lightly pull threads to gather the long tier one edge to fit the bottom of your front bodice edge. Pin, and sew ½” with a stretch stitch, and remove any visible basting stitches on front side. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3348.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>11) Repeat for Back Bodice.</p>\n\n<p>12) Next we will sew our final tier, tier 2 to the bottom of tier one. Again, sew basting stitches at ¼” and ½” along the top of tier two. Match center and ends for both pieces, lightly pull threads and evenly space gathers to fit, pin in place. Sew at ½” using a stretch stitch, remove any visible threads on the right side. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3351.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>13) Repeat for back bodice. </p>\n\n<p>14) Next we need to sew our shoulder seams together. Pin front and back shoulders right sides together. Sew at ½” using a stretch stitch: zig zag or lightening stitch. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2841%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>15) Now it’s time to sew in our sleeves. We are going to pin our sleeve cap into the armhole, right sides together. Match up your corners at the end of your cap and armhole, and the center of your sleeve to the shoulder seam. Sew at ½”using a stretch stitch.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3359.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3357.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3358.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>16) With right sides facing, pin your side seams and sleeves together from sleeve hem to dress hem on both sides of your dress. Sew each side at ½”, with a stretch stitch. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3360.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3361.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>17) Almost done! Now let’s finish our neckline. Fold your neckline band in half along the fold, right sides together. Sew at ½”. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2846%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3433.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>18) Now fold your neckband piece in half wrong sides together and pin in place instead of ironing. </p>\n\n<p>19) Using pins, mark the front, back and sides of your neckband, quartering it. This helps keep it even when pinning it to the neckline. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2840%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>20) Pin your neck band to your neckline, right sides together, pinning first at shoulder seams and front and back centers. Lightly stretch your neck band (not your neckline) to fit and pin the rest of your neckband in place. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/FullSizeRender%20%2839%29.jpg\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew at ½” using a stretch stitch. Trim your seam allowance, and topstitch along the neckline to keep the seam allowance laying down. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3439.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>21) Now let’s hem our sleeve. Wrap your ¼” elastic around where your sleeve will end along your arm to where it’s just fitted, and cut two pieces to this length.</p>\n\n<p>22) Using my fingers and no iron, I folded each sleeve end in at ¼” and then ½”. Pin this in place. Edgestitch around your casing using a straight stitch, making sure to leave about ½” opening to insert your elastic. Repeat for your other sleeve. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3443.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>23) Attach a safety pin to one end of your elastic, and insert it into your sleeve casing. Sew your two elastic ends together (make sure there’s no twisting inside your sleeve casing before sewing). Push the elastic into your casing completely, and edgestitch your opening closed. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3446.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>24) Hem the bottom of your dress. Again, using my fingers, I folded my hem at ¼” and then ½” and pinned in place all the way around. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3440.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Edgestitch using a straight stitch</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3441.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>25) Cut your cording in half exactly and insert your cording into your waist casing. Insert each piece like the letter U into each side, so two ends come out on each side. Tie a little knot at the end of your cording once it is inserted. </p>\n\n<p>You did it! I hope you enjoy your new dress! Thanks for following along! </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3980.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Velvet%20Dress/IMG_3979.JPG\" alt=\"Velvet\" />\n</p>",

Right sides together, sew a 3/4\" seam allowance and finger press open. When sewing the seam, backstitch at 6 1/2\" from each edge. If making the kids size floor pouf, backstitch at 3 1/2\" from each edge. Reinforcing by backstitching is necessary because later when you open up part of the seam to reveal the zipper, the remaining seam still needs to be strong and not be able to be pulled apart. <BR>Pin zipper within the seam allowance, and top stitch the zipper with a zipper foot. You can topstitch the zipper on the underside of the seam, or the top of the seam - whichever your preference. Use a seam ripper to open up the seam, revealing the sliding zipper.<BR>You'll notice the seam opening for the zipper is a little shorter than the zipper length - this will allow a little pocket for the zipper pull to be tucked into once zipped, eliminating any urge to unzip and spill the beans!\n\nPinned Zipper – underside and top side of seam shown:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cowhide Floor Cushion](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cowhide%20Poufs/Step%202.1%20zipper%20pinned.jpg)\n</p>\n \nTop Stitch Zipper into seam:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cowhide Floor Cushion](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cowhide%20Poufs/Step%202.2%20Top%20stitch%20zipper.JPG)\n</p>\n \nOpen up seam to reveal zipper using a seam ripper:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cowhide Floor Cushion](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cowhide%20Poufs/Step%202.3%20ripper%20zipper.JPG)\n</p>\n \n#####Step 3\nSewing wrong sides together, stitch 5/8’’ seam allowance along both long edges of the rectangles.\n\n#####Step 4\nJoin the side seams together in the center and sew along the remaining short end of the rectangle piece.

The liner insert is not required to complete the project, but recommended if you want to change or easily clean the exterior cover.\n\n#####Step 6\nPour your bean bag fill into the liner. Warning – this is a 2 person job and should be done VERY carefully. Those beans are tricky, move quickly and love static electricity; the less you come in contact with them the better!\n\n \nPoof!

Warning – this is a 2 person job and should be done VERY carefully.

This has a fair amount of fabric waste, because you’ll need a yard each if you want more than 3 squares out of each fabric.\n\n######Some other fabric cutting options for the fronts:\n* 14 half yard cuts\n* 7-8 full yard cuts (depending on if you’re fussy cutting or not)\n\n####Assembling your quilt top\nThis is a very simple quilt. The trickiest part will be the pressing.\n\nTo create your patchwork top, we’re going to use a ½” seam allowance due to the looser weave of the fabric. \n\nFirst, determine your preferred layout. I like to lay them all out on the floor and play around with the color placement. Then, I take a picture of it and use that to reference during sewing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_7249.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou’ll sew  two squares together, and then another two. I then make patches of four, and then sew into columns of 2x6.\n\nHere’s a little pressing diagram for a block of four.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/Pressing%20Diagram%201.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew your first two blocks together, right sides together. Then press the seam to the RIGHT.\nSew your second two blocks together, right sides together, then press that seam to the LEFT.\n\nYour seams should be nicely nested with that pressing technique.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2057.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSee how the chartreuse block’s seam is pressed to the right? The one on the bottom will have its seam pressed to the left.\n\nRepeat this until you have 3 of these, and then make a column. In the end, you should have 4 columns. 3 of these columns will be 2x6, one will be 1x6. For the last column, you can just sew the blocks in segments of 2, and then all together. No need for squares here.\n\nHere is how we want to sew the quilt top. This diagram shows how to press your seams. The first column you will press your seams down, the second up, and so on. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/Pressing%20Diagram%202.PNG)\n</p>\n\nThis will make sewing your columns together (still a ½” seam allowance) a lot easier. Sew the first two columns together, then the second two, and then sew THOSE two together. \n\n####Backing\nTo make your backing, cut your 4.5 yards in half, and then sew together along the selvedge edges with a ½” seam allowance. \n\n####Sewing your quilt together\n\nNow we’ll make the quilt!\n\nWe want to make a sandwich a little different than we would a standard quilt. You will want to have your backing and quilt top pinned right sides together, and then the batting on top of your quilt top. Trim your batting and backing to fit your quilt top. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2063_edit.JPG)\n</p>\n\nPin along the edges every few inches all the way around (1/2” seam allowance), and then sew along those edges, leaving an opening that is about 8” wide, backstitching when you begin and end.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2065.JPG)\n</p>\n\nClip your corners, and then turn right sides out. Your batting should be in the middle now, with the right sides of your back and front facing outwards.\n\nFlatten our your blanket, making sure your corners are nice and pointed.\n\n####Closing the opening\nPin the opening closed that we used to turn the quilt. Using a small hand needle and thread, close up this opening with a ladder stitch.\n\nAfter burying your knot in the seam, follow the pictures to create a ladder stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2066.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2067.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIt’s that simple, you’ll end up with an invisible stitch once you tug on your working thread. Do this until the entire opening is closed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2068.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Tying your quilt\nWith a doll needle and your thread, cut off a long length to work with. No need to make a knot.\n\nI tied at the corners and middle of each block, but you can do as many as you want. Just make sure you have no less than that amount. Insert your needle to the back and then back to the front without pulling through.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2069.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\nPull your thread through, all the way to the end so there’s about an inch left. Cut off an inch to the other side, and make a knot with the two ends. You’ll want to double knot to make it extra secure.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2070.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTrim your ends if you have extra. Aim for about ½”-1” length on each tail.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2072.JPG)\n</p>\n\nRepeat until you’ve tied off the whole quilt.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_2073_edit.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAnd you’re finished! Cuddle up and enjoy!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Loominous Tie Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Loominous%20Tie%20Quilt/IMG_7099.jpg)\n</p>\n",

I have a blog called <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a> and also try to deliver daily home inspirations on Instagram @househomemade. My main goal is to share ways of having a polished, put together home on a small budget. I thrift, re-purpose and makeover anything that stands still for too long. For real, ask my family. \n \nI recently used a combo of fabric.com's home decor fabrics to change up our master bedroom. Here is the \"before\". It was totally fine but I'm on a color, contrast and pattern kick so the after makes me so happy!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/IMG_4477.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThis is the \"after!\"\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/chair%20and%20curtains.jpg)\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332907/robert-allen-home-handcut-shapes-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-robert_allen_handcut_shapes\" target=\"_blank\">shop diamond curtain fabric</a> // <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0329712/udder-madness-cow-upholstery-black?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-udder_madness_black\" target=\"_blank\">shop cow chair fabric</a>\n\nI've used fabric.com many-a-time in my own designs so I'm so honored they asked me to guest blog for them today. I hope I can help you make the task of fabric mixing and matching feel a little less overwhelming . \n \nWhen choosing fabrics, I look at scale, color and pattern. I'll try to break down these tips into 3 categories but really they are related and each works with the other to create a good pairing so let me try to explain.  \n \n####Scale\nChecking how big or small a pattern is online can be a little bit trickier than when you're seeing it at the store but look at the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477076/genevieve-gorder-flock-velvet-steam?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-gen_gorder_flock_velvet_grey\" target=\"_blank\">this amazing fabric</a>. See the ruler? It shows you that on this fabric, each bird’s wingspan is 8\" wide. Sometimes I get out a ruler so that I can see just how big that will end up being. This can better help you to visualize the fabric in a space. It also can help determine uses for a certain pattern. You might not want something this bold to be the curtain pattern for 4 windows in a room, so you might decide to do use this fabric for a few throw pillows and something more subdued for the curtains. OR you might be awesome and bold and rock this fabric all over those windows and if that's the case, please invite me over to see them and hug them. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/flock%20velvet.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Pattern\nWhen I'm shopping for multiple fabrics I try to mix and match patterns that complement each other and not usually ones that are in the same family. For example, something geometric with stripes or hard angles works really well with something floral or more organic looking. A print that looks hand-drawn usually looks better with something more structured. \n \n####Color\nI always try to pick something that comes across as more of a solid color paired with something more colorful when using multiple fabrics. You can see in each of my pairings (there are more at the end of this post), one simpler, less colorful fabric and another more bold. It lets them both shine without competing for attention. One fabric is usually more neutral than the other. In the pairing below, I marked some examples of why these would work well together in a space.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/stripeslightsmall%20scale.png)\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0342090/magnolia-home-fashions-cottage-stripe-tranquil?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-cottage_stripe\" target=\"_blank\">shop stripe fabric</a> // <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0462078/magnolia-home-fashions-seabrook-harbor?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-seabrook_harbor\" target=\"_blank\">shop floral fabric</a>\n\nThe striped fabric is so small scale that from afar it almost reads like a solid, working well with the bold floral fabric but letting shine.  \n \n The fabric I chose for our bedroom is pretty eclectic. To me eclectic means, if you like it, choose it. I paired the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332907/robert-allen-home-handcut-shapes-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-robert_allen_handcut_shapes\" target=\"_blank\">vintage diamond geometric</a> pattern with the organic, natural look of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0329712/udder-madness-cow-upholstery-black?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-udder_madness_black\" target=\"_blank\">cow print</a>. They’re in the same color family but the diamonds act a little more as the neutral to balance the two out.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/1.png)\n</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332907/robert-allen-home-handcut-shapes-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-robert_allen_handcut_shapes\" target=\"_blank\">shop diamond fabric</a> // <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0329712/udder-madness-cow-upholstery-black?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-udder_madness_black\" target=\"_blank\">shop cowhide fabric</a>\n\n\nThe next two fabrics are a little more straight-forward than my pick. The smaller scale, neutral <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/jaclyn-smith-style-diamonds?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-diamonds\" target=\"_blank\">diamond</a> pattern works so well with the big, bold, colorful <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0347225/hgtv-home-garden-odyssey-slub-fog?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-hgtv_odyssey\" target=\"_blank\">floral</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/2.png)\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/jaclyn-smith-style-diamonds?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-diamonds\" target=\"_blank\">shop diamond fabric</a> //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0347225/hgtv-home-garden-odyssey-slub-fog?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-hgtv_odyssey\" target=\"_blank\">shop garden odyssey fabric</a>\n\n\nThe next one is a modern take on a throwback. The glam looking <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0333348/richloom-solarium-outdoor-balmoral-opal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-solarium_balmoral\" target=\"_blank\">banana leaf</a> is back in style and I love it with the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432879/premier-prints-tribal-twill-canal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-tribal_twill\" target=\"_blank\">tribal looking geometric</a>. I feel like it would be an obvious choice to pull out the green in the leaf fabric so I love that the other, lighter fabric pulls out the less prominent aqua. Turquoise? Aqua? I was an art teacher. I should know the difference. Anyway, that's a tip in itself. When picking accent colors, go for the less obvious choice, it will make you look like more of a mixing wizard.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/3.jpg)\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0333348/richloom-solarium-outdoor-balmoral-opal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-solarium_balmoral\" target=\"_blank\">shop banana leaf fabric</a> //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432879/premier-prints-tribal-twill-canal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-tribal_twill\" target=\"_blank\">shop tribal geometric</a>\n\nThis next pair is one of my favorites. There is really not much <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0277685/lacefield-mumbai-indian-blue?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-indian_blue\" target=\"_blank\">indigo blue</a> in our house but it's such a timeless pick and I love this pattern on this fabric. Paired with the striped, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ah-398/10oz-chenille-natural?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-chenille_natural\" target=\"_blank\">textured chenille</a> is so dreamy and it's a great balance to the darkness that the blue fabric could bring to a room.\n\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/4.png)\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ah-398/10oz-chenille-natural?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-chenille_natural\" target=\"_blank\">shop chenille fabric</a>  //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0277685/lacefield-mumbai-indian-blue?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-indian_blue\" target=\"_blank\">shop indian blue fabric</a>\n\n\nThis next pairing, I realize might not be everyone's cup of tea but if I had some extra funds and an extra room laying around, I'd love to design a space around this pairing. I love the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456715/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-canvas-folk-birds-peach?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-les_fleur_folk_birds\" target=\"_blank\">floral, rust colored fabric</a>. It's so vintage looking and cool. It’s toned down a bit with the almost <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430828/pkaufmann-vintage-find-indigo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-vintage_indigo\" target=\"_blank\">monochromatic navy</a> fabric but I still love its bold pattern too.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/5.jpg)\n</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456715/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-canvas-folk-birds-peach?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-les_fleur_folk_birds\" target=\"_blank\">shop rustic birds fabric</a>  //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430828/pkaufmann-vintage-find-indigo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-vintage_indigo\" target=\"_blank\">shop vintage indigo fabric</a>\n\nThis next pair might lack color but I love the prints on each and black and white can work so well in so many spaces. While both are organic looking, it's still the difference between a floral and a geometric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/6.jpg)\n</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458267/lacefield-villa-linen-granite-ashby?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-linen_granite_ashby\" target=\"_blank\">shop black leaf fabric</a> //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408577/golding-ikat-spots-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-ikat_charcoal\" target=\"_blank\">shop ikat fabric</a>\n\n\nThese next 2 fabrics really differ in style. The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0319366/magnolia-home-fashions-adele-slate?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-adele_slate\" target=\"_blank\">floral</a> is neutral and almost reminds me of something you'd see in a farm-house style space. The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0420585/richloom-r-gallery-acela-birch?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-acela_birch\" target=\"_blank\">diamond pattern</a> is retro looking in style and color but I think they work so well together.\n\n  \n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/7.jpg)\n</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0319366/magnolia-home-fashions-adele-slate?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-adele_slate\" target=\"_blank\">shop floral fabric</a> //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0420585/richloom-r-gallery-acela-birch?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-acela_birch\" target=\"_blank\">shop acela birch fabric</a>\n\n\n\nThe last one I included because I am using this combo in our living room right now.  You can't go wrong with a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0374394/alpine-upholstery-velvet-moss?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-velvet_moss\" target=\"_blank\">velveteen fabric</a> and this chair was thrifted and has been given new life a few times thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408626/p-kaufmann-longrock-fiesta?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-longrock_fiesta\" target=\"_blank\">good fabric</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/8.jpg)\n</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0374394/alpine-upholstery-velvet-moss?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-velvet_moss\" target=\"_blank\">shop green velvet fabric</a>  //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408626/p-kaufmann-longrock-fiesta?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-longrock_fiesta\" target=\"_blank\">shop longrock fiesta fabric</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/chair%20cushion.jpg)\n</p> \n\n\nI hope mixing fabrics doesn't seem so daunting now. If all else fails, call it 'eclectic'!\n\nPin from below to save or share! Happy mixing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Mixing Matching](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/fabric.com%20pin.png)\n</p>\n \n",

When picking accent colors, go for the less obvious choice, it will make you look like more of a mixing wizard.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Mixing%20and%20Matching/3.jpg\" alt=\"House Homemade Mixing Matching\" />\n</p>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0333348/richloom-solarium-outdoor-balmoral-opal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-solarium_balmoral\" target=\"_blank\">shop banana leaf fabric</a> //  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432879/premier-prints-tribal-twill-canal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_curtains_chair-_-tribal_twill\" target=\"_blank\">shop tribal geometric</a></p>\n\n<p>This next pair is one of my favorites.

Apply it to one cotton print rectangle and leverage the grid paper backing to smooth onto the fabric, as shown here:\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Vinyl Placemats](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Vinyl%20Placemats/placemat%20laminating%201-.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAs the directions state, use the paper to iron on the vinyl, make sure the grid side of the paper is face up while ironing. \n\nThe directions state to press for 8 seconds, then flip over and press 4 more seconds. Because this surface area is so large to laminate, I ironed in a slow figure-8 motion, let it cool, repositioned my paper, and continued down the length of the rectangle. Then flipped it over, used the paper as a barrier again and ironed in a figure-8 motion on the back as well. Each part of the fabric didn’t get 8 full seconds of iron pressing, however, my method seemed to work, as the vinyl was successfully laminated. If you iron too long, the vinyl will start to melt and bubble. 10 Yards of Heat n Bond is actually about ½ yard too much, as it’s intended to test on a scrap piece of cotton first. Definitely test and find your best ironing groove first before tackling your sixteen placemat pieces.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Vinyl Placemats](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Vinyl%20Placemats/placemat%20ironing%20vinyl.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Step 3: Sew 'em up!\nUse clips to hold in place. Pins cannot be used since it will leave a permanent hole in the vinyl fabric.\n\nTake two coordinating laminated rectangles and sew right sides together, Use a 5/8’’ – ¾’’ seam allowance, leaving a 12’’ opening along the length of the rectangle, in order to flip it inside out. The variation in seam allowance allows some forgiveness in order to maintain the rectangle shape. Remember, it’s more important to not warp the rectangle than to have a perfectly matching seam allowance.\n\n####Step 4: Flip 'em!\nGrade your seam allowance edges and clip your corners so that the seam allowance will lay nicely once flipped.\n\nWhere the opening is, fold the edges down and iron with the grid paper so it will be easier to top stitch closed after flipping right side out.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Vinyl Placemats](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Vinyl%20Placemats/placemat%20opening%20grade%20clip-.jpg)\n</p>\n \nUsing the 12’’ opening, flip the placemat right side out. \n\nWarning – when you flip the placemat right side out- the vinyl will crinkle and crunch. The lovely smooth vinyl rectangles will be no more; it will have some texture due to the bends from flipping it inside out. \n\nDo not fret – this is how this vinyl behaves. But it’s OK. You can use the grid paper and iron the placemat again to smooth out a lot of the creases, but these placemats will not have a super-smooth appearance. A slight bummer, I know, but the function and style of these outweighs the creased texture developed during the making, trust me. \n\n####Step 5: Topstitch 'em!\nOnce you have your placemat flipped right side out, top stitch 3/8’’ from the edge.\n\nNow you have great looking placemats that have ultimate function. They’re large enough to contain a mess from eating, crafts and other activities and easy enough to just wipe clean.  \n\nAnother tip for vinyl placemats: rub a few drops of water to the underside of the placemat and it won’t slide around on the table.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Vinyl Placemats](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Vinyl%20Placemats/placemat%20alternate%20table-.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n \n",

I share tutorials and tips for making a house a home on a budget over at <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a> and try to provide daily decor ideas over on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/househomemade/\" target=\"_blank\">@househomemade</a>. You can find my previous fabric.com post about pattern mixing <a href=\"https://blog.fabric.com/tips-for-mixing-matching-fabric-in-your-home/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I'm so happy to be back! \n\nI'm excited to show you today's project! I love the result, and don't worry, I'll tell you the things that you can anticipate and maybe avoid should you be crazy/awesome enough to staple fabric onto your walls.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/1%20and%2018.JPG)\n</p>\n\nRecently, over on my blog, I shared a before picture of our very sad, very boring hallway.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/2.JPG)\n</p>\n\nand made it better a few weeks ago by making this great picture ledge.  It's good, but I wanted a little something else.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/3.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI read this article on ways to make a long hallway appear not so long.  One of the ways mentioned was to paint the back wall a different color. It makes sense. The color brings your eye / your attention to the end of the hall, making it not seem so long. It's an illusion. \n\nNow, our hallway isn't crazy long or anything but it was boring and does deserve some cuteness. I was going to paint it but then got the chance to collaborate with fabric.com on another project and I thought a pattern would look amazing in this tiny little space. When I told them my idea was to upholster an accent wall, they were all for it!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/4.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHere's what I used for this project: \n\n####Materials:\n* 3 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_fabric_wall-_-home_decor_fabric\" target=\"_blank\">medium weight fabric</a> (I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458246/lacefield-tahitian-stitch-tangerine?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_fabric_wall-_-lacefield_stitch\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>)\n* An <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=irons&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-house_homemade_fabric_wall-_-irons\" target=\"_blank\">iron</a> and ironing board\n* Staple gun \n* Staples \n* Xacto knife\n* Sharpies \n* Small screwdriver \n* Needle nose pliers (for mistakes...I only used them once)\n\nI measured my wall and luckily is was a bit narrower than the 54\" wide fabric. You could try and match seams if you have a wider wall or look for a wider fabric while searching. We have 8ft ceilings so I ordered 3 yards of fabric to give me a little extra room to work.\n\nTo start off, I ironed the seam that would be at the top of the wall. I wanted to make sure I started with a straight line and a straight pattern.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/5.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI wanted to be able to hide the staples at the top.  So with another set of hands, courtesy of a sweet friend, we held the fabric where we wanted it, made sure it was centered on the wall, and stapled it from underneath, making sure the staples were right up against the fold and the crown molding.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/6.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/7.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext we cut away the excess fabric from the middle and used it for a cute throw pillow (just sayin').\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/8.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI pulled the fabric taut and started stapling above the door jamb.  Before I started stapling down either side of the door I had to make a small cut in the excess fabric around the door trim to keep the fabric flush with the wall.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/9.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI definitely didn't want to cut too much so I just kept making small cuts and checking until the fabric was able to be stapled around the trim.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/10.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe sides are where I had a little bit of trouble, only because the space between the closet door and the side walls was so narrow that I couldn't lay my staple gun in there at a correct angle to get a flush staple.  I took a picture of the angle of the stapler on the side sections. So, you'd only have this problem if you're upholstering a wall that is narrower than your staple gun is long. These sides are 4\" wide.\n\nI stapled the sides down at this angle and then it was time to cut the excess fabric. I wanted to try and complete the wall with no trim around it. Just a clean cut line. This is where I ran into my next little problem. I couldn't cut the fabric as easily as I had hoped. I used an xacto knife and thought it would be so easy but I think the issue goes back to the angle in which I had to staple. Because I couldn't staple straight up against the cut edge, the fabric pulled a bit.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/11.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI carefully cut down the sides and around the door then used a tiny screw driver to tuck extra little threads or edges back behind our trim.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/12.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI've seen this project done before, by masters I might add, and they completed their wall with trim around the edge. Since our little accent wall was so small I wanted to try and stay away from that. If you have a bigger space, it probably would be the easiest thing. This is where the sharpies came in.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/13.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI used an orange and black sharpie to make the staples disappear into the fabric. I think it worked out pretty well. You might think this looks a little unfinished but you would never notice them unless you walked right up to it and looked for them.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/14.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI love how it transformed our boring hallway! It's colorful and adds a great pattern but it's also easily removable if we decide we don't want it anymore. Just pull out the staples and, because it's paneling, we might have to lightly sand, then paint! Love it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/15.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/16.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIf you pull out further into our living area you can see how the orange works so well with this great rug. And see the throw pillow behind the kitty? An added bonus!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wall Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wall%20Covering/1%20and%2018.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThank you, fabric.com, for the fabric and for your willingness to let me try something unconventional.

Today I'm happy to share with you a tutorial for a fun Pullover Toddler Bib. This style of baby bib has become a staple in my household. It goes on easily, is tough for my toddler to pull off, and provides great coverage for all those messy toddler meals. I recently sewed these up in several fun prints with things on them that he recognizes. It has been so fun to let him choose which one he wants to wear as he's been learning to talk.\n\n####Pullover Toddler Bib Tutorial\n\nFinished dimensions: 9'' x 13'' with a 5 1/2 '' neck opening\nFits toddler with a head circumference of 20 inches or smaller\n\n####Materials: \n* 1/3 yd Print fabric, quilting cotton (we chose <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0270192/michael-miller-into-the-forest-green?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-into_the_forest\" target=\"_blank\">this adorable Michael Miller print</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/michael-miller-dumb-dot?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-michael_miller_dumb_dot\" target=\"_blank\">this polka dot</a> in red)\n* 1/3 yd <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/dimple-dot-cuddle?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-dimple_dot_cuddle\" target=\"_blank\">Minky Dimple Dot Cuddle</a> fabric (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dg-549/shannon-minky-cuddle-dimple-dot-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-dimple_dot_cuddle_charcoal\" target=\"_blank\">this color</a>)\n* 1/4 yd knit ribbing (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0412553/t-knit-ribbing-red?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-ribbing\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>)\n* Small bowl or circle template with a 5’’ diameter\n* Marking pen\n* Coordinating <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread&cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-thread\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>\n\nYou can make 3 bibs with this much fabric!\n\n#####For each bib cut:\n* 1 rectangle 10’’ X 14’’ from the print fabric\n* 1 rectangle 10’’ X 14’’ from the Minky fabric\n* 1 strip 2 1/2\" X 14\" from the knit ribbing, if you have very stretchy ribbing you may need to shorten this length\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pullover Toddler Bibs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Bibs/Cutting.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Sewing:\nWith right sides together lay the print fabric on top of the Minky fabric. The Minky tends to shift easily so press the 2 pieces together and smooth them out with your hands until it all lays flat. If the Minky doesn’t line up perfectly don’t worry too much. Place pins in the middle of the four sides to hold the minky fabric in place. Place the circle template or bowl in a corner and trace around it using the marking pen to create a curved corner. Repeat for each corner.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pullover Toddler Bibs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Bibs/Step%201.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut along the traced line to trim the corners and sew around all the edges with a 3/8’’ seam allowance.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pullover Toddler Bibs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Bibs/Step%202.jpg)\n</p>\n\nClip notches into the seam allowance of each curve being careful to not clip into the stitches.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pullover Toddler Bibs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Bibs/Step%203.jpg)\n</p> \n\nDraw a circle for the neck hole using the circle template or bowl. Position it in the center and about 1 1/2’’ from the top edge.

At this point you can check to make sure the ribbing fits over your baby’s head if you’d like. Most ribbing has great stretch and recovery but if yours doesn’t you may need to cut your ribbing strip longer.

This is Sarah from Blue Susan Makes. Today I'm happy to share with you a tutorial for a fun Pullover Toddler Bib. This style of baby bib has become a staple in my household. It goes on easily, is tough for my toddler to pull off, and provides great coverage for all those messy toddler meals. I recently sewed these up in several fun prints with things on them that he recognizes. It has been so fun to let him choose which one he wants to wear as he's been learning to talk.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pullovertoddlerbibtutorial\">Pullover Toddler Bib Tutorial</h4>\n\n<p>Finished dimensions: 9'' x 13'' with a 5 1/2 '' neck opening <br />\nFits toddler with a head circumference of 20 inches or smaller</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"materials\">Materials:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1/3 yd Print fabric, quilting cotton (we chose <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0270192/michael-miller-into-the-forest-green?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-into_the_forest\" target=\"_blank\">this adorable Michael Miller print</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/michael-miller-dumb-dot?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-michael_miller_dumb_dot\" target=\"_blank\">this polka dot</a> in red)</li>\n<li>1/3 yd <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/dimple-dot-cuddle?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-dimple_dot_cuddle\" target=\"_blank\">Minky Dimple Dot Cuddle</a> fabric (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dg-549/shannon-minky-cuddle-dimple-dot-charcoal?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-dimple_dot_cuddle_charcoal\" target=\"_blank\">this color</a>)</li>\n<li>1/4 yd knit ribbing (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0412553/t-knit-ribbing-red?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-ribbing\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>)</li>\n<li>Small bowl or circle template with a 5’’ diameter</li>\n<li>Marking pen</li>\n<li>Coordinating <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread&amp;cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-pullover_toddler_bibs-_-thread\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can make 3 bibs with this much fabric!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"foreachbibcut\">For each bib cut:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 rectangle 10’’ X 14’’ from the print fabric</li>\n<li>1 rectangle 10’’ X 14’’ from the Minky fabric</li>\n<li>1 strip 2 1/2\" X 14\" from the knit ribbing, if you have very stretchy ribbing you may need to shorten this length</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Bibs/Cutting.jpg\" alt=\"Pullover Toddler Bibs\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewing\">Sewing:</h4>\n\n<p>With right sides together lay the print fabric on top of the Minky fabric.

Here’s what I did to change things up and make the project a little faster and little more to my style:\n\nProbably the biggest time saving step was not quilting my main fabric to my lining fabric with the soft and stable in between. I just cut the pieces out that were too be quilted in the dimensions used after quilting instead of before. I basted these pieces together instead, with a scant ¼” seam.\n\nInstead of making the handles from scratch and using hardware, I covered the top of the cotton webbing with bias tape and simply top stitched them down, sewing them to the front and back sides of the caddy before putting on the inside and outside pockets so the seams would be hidden.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2185.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou can see the crease down the middle where I folded to get an even strip. Use the tutorial in the instructions for how to make double fold bias tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2187.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI like the look and you don’t have to get hardware or do any extra sewing! I cut my handles at 20” each.\n\nI also omitted the side pockets, and I used a different method of binding the unfinished edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2188.JPG)\n</p>\n\nI sewed the binding to one side by machine, and brought it around to the front to hand stitch with an invisible ladder stitch.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the final product!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2197.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIt's good for knitting supplies, too.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2205.JPG)\n</p>\n####Alternate fabric choices\nThis is such a versatile pattern, you can use all of your favorite prints for a bag you’ll truly love.

Here’s what I did to change things up and make the project a little faster and little more to my style:</p>\n\n<p>Probably the biggest time saving step was not quilting my main fabric to my lining fabric with the soft and stable in between. I just cut the pieces out that were too be quilted in the dimensions used after quilting instead of before. I basted these pieces together instead, with a scant ¼” seam.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of making the handles from scratch and using hardware, I covered the top of the cotton webbing with bias tape and simply top stitched them down, sewing them to the front and back sides of the caddy before putting on the inside and outside pockets so the seams would be hidden.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2185.JPG\" alt=\"Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>You can see the crease down the middle where I folded to get an even strip.

I cut my handles at 20” each.</p>\n\n<p>I also omitted the side pockets, and I used a different method of binding the unfinished edges.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2188.JPG\" alt=\"Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I sewed the binding to one side by machine, and brought it around to the front to hand stitch with an invisible ladder stitch.</p>\n\n<p>I’m pretty happy with the final product!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2197.JPG\" alt=\"Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>It's good for knitting supplies, too.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rifle%20Sewing%20Caddy/IMG_2205.JPG\" alt=\"Rifle Paper Sewing Caddy\" />\n</p>  \n\n<h4 id=\"alternatefabricchoices\">Alternate fabric choices</h4>\n\n<p>This is such a versatile pattern, you can use all of your favorite prints for a bag you’ll truly love.

This precaution ensures your fabrics won’t shrink at a different rate and distort your finished garment.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Washed-Fabric.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 2:  Main Fabric\n\nTaking your main fabric, cut out the pattern pieces according to your pattern’s instructions.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Main-Fabric-Pieces.png)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3:  Lining Fabric\n\nTaking your lining fabric, cut out the same pattern pieces again exactly as you did in Step 2.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Lining-Pieces.png)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4:  Pinning\n\nPlace each of your corresponding fabric pieces wrong sides together and pin all around.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Pinning.png)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5:  Basting\n\nAfter looking up the seam allowance given by your pattern, baste your layers together staying within that seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Baste.png)\n</p>\n\nRepeat this step for each of your corresponding pieces.\n\nThe Daffodil Top pattern allows for a 1/4″ to 1/2” seam allowance throughout, so as long as I baste around each piece using a 1/8”-1/4″ seam allowance, the basting stitches won’t be visible when I sew my garment together.\n\n####Step 6:  Sew Your Garment\n\nAfter basting together each of your corresponding pieces, you will treat them as one piece of fabric. Sew your garment according to your pattern’s instructions.\n\nThis is the inside of the Daffodil top where you can see the main fabric through the voile lining.  You can also see all of my seams because the lining fabric was sewn as part of my main fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Lining.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe paired this absolutely gorgeous top with <a href=\"http://www.tiedyedivapatterns.com/product/daffodil-capri-pants-faux-wrap-ruffle-pants-1-10-years\" target=\"_blank\">Tie Dye Diva's Daffodil Capri Pants pattern</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0312550/kaufman-kaufman-brussels-washer-linen-blend-blush?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-how_to_sew_underlining-_-linen_blush\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kaufman Brussels Washer Linen in Blend Blush</a>.

I think there’s just about every color in those hearts which makes selecting coordinating trim and notions fun!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Daffodil-Back.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou cannot see through this top at all thanks to our underlining.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Top-Head-On.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe underlining also offers structure to the elastic gathers and silhouette of the top.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Top-Back.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Side.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow you can pore over those semi-transparent fabrics with confidence!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sew an Underlining](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/How%20to%20Sew%20an%20Underlining/Hearts.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe hope you loved this tutorial!

Some sequin fabrics have a little stretch, like the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/glitz-sequin-and-mesh?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_sequins-_-glitz_sequins_full_collection\" target=\"_blank\">Glitz Sequin & Mesh Collection</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/telio-flashdance-mermaid-sequins?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_sequins-_-telio_flashdance_mermaid\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Flashdance Mermaid Sequin Knit Collection</a>. This makes them a little easier to work with. You can make form fitting dresses, skirts, and costumes with ease. This comes from sewing the sequins onto a fabric with stretch. The Glitz are mesh fabrics, and the Flashdance is sewn onto jersey.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/telio-flashdance-mermaid-sequins?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sewing_101_sequins-_-telio_flashdance_mermaid\" target=\"_blank\">Starlight Sequin Fabrics</a>are sewn onto a polyester lining for a sturdier finished fabric with zero stretch. These can still be used for apparel, but you’ll want to stay away from figure hugging dresses and skirts (it might be a little challenging to move in them!)\n\nRegardless of your sequin project, you’ll want to use a lining for any garment. The back of the fabric is not comfortable against the skin, due to the threads that keep the sequins attached on the face side.\n\nThe hardest part about sewing with sequins is that needles have a hard time sewing through them, so you have to clear the seam allowance free of them in order to sew properly. It is the safest method, with the best finished result. It’s also the easiest on your sewing machine and needles. However, we’ll also show you how to sew something without clearing the seam allowance if you want to go that route.\n\n####Preparing Your Seam Allowances\nFor each method, mark your seam allowances before cutting so you don’t go too far in. \n\n#####Method 1:\n\nThis method keeps the line of stitching intact, which keeps the sequins in the rest of the line of stitching from coming out unexpectedly. Using a pair of scissors, lift a line of sequins up so that you can see their bases. \n  \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing With Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Sequins/IMG_2321.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe threads go through those little holes that you see there. You will want to cut the sequins so that those little holes are exposed, and you can work the rest of the sequin out. Those little suckers can be very stubborn!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing With Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Sequins/IMG_2323.JPG)\n</p>\n\nContinue until you have your desired area clear of sequins.\n\n#####Method 2:\n\nWith a seam ripper and working from the back of the fabric, rip out the stitching in your desired area until there aren’t any more sequins.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing With Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Sequins/IMG_2320.JPG)\n</p>\n\nBoth of these are time consuming, but worth it if you are making something that you have to look at every day. If you don’t clear the seam allowances, you’ll end up with broken needles and jagged sequins from the right side of the seam.\n\nAfter you clear the seam allowances, sew in the method best for your fabric. For the sequin knits, you might want to use a jersey needle and a zig zag!\n\n####Sewing Without Preparing Seam Allowances\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing With Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Sequins/IMG_2328.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIf you aren’t planning to clear the seams, you CAN sew anyway. Be careful, however, because a lot of broken needles can occur, which can be a bit of a safety hazard! Needles breaking and flying off your machine can be very dangerous, so if you’re going this route, be extra careful. \n\nUse a needle that is thin and sharp, not a heavy duty or denim needle, because they will get stuck in the sequins. \n\nUse a long stitch length and go slowly!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing With Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Sequins/IMG_2296.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIf you can, try to stay in the channels between rows of sequins to minimize your contact with them and risk of needle breakage. \n\nHappy sewing with sequins!\n",

I decided to use the <a href=\"https://www.grainlinestudio.com/2013/08/05/hemlock-tee-pattern-its-free/\" target=\"_blank\">free Hemlock tee pattern by Grainline Studio</a>. I made a few modifications to make it more like a sweatshirt than a shirt. \n\nTo make the modifications, I used a sweatshirt that fit me well for comparison, and lengthened the sleeves, shortened the body, and added 2.5 inch bands instead hemming. If you are not comfortable making minor modifications to patterns, you could easily use the <a href=\"http://shop.grainlinestudio.com/products/linden-sweatshirt\" target=\"_blank\">Linden sweatshirt pattern by Grainline Studio</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Dip Dye Sweatshirt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Dip%20Dye%20Sweatshirt/linden_pattern_grainline.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAfter I sewed up the sweatshirt, it was time for the scary part. The dye. I used the <a href=\"https://www.ritstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ColorRit_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">color formula guide</a> available on the Rit Studio website to pick out my color and get the formula. I choose Neutral 1 #311 which mixed 1 tsp <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0340188/rit-dye-powder-tan?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-dip_dye_sweatshirt-_-rit_dye_tan\" target=\"_blank\">Tan</a> and 1/8 tsp <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0340182/rit-dye-powder-purple?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-dip_dye_sweatshirt-_-rit_dye_purple\" target=\"_blank\">Purple</a> per 1 cup of water, both colors are available <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/rit-dye-powder?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-dip_dye_sweatshirt-_-rit_dye\" target=\"_blank\">at fabric.com here</a>.\n\nI made my dye bath with 10 cups of water total, in a large pot with hot water. I got the entire sweatshirt wet and wrung it out first and then carefully placed the body in the dye bath about 2/3 as high as I wanted the color to go. I let it sit for a minute or two, kind of swirling the fabric around making sure it was coloring evenly. The color absorbed a few inches higher than the dye bath. Then I lifted the body out and left the bottom 1/3 in the dye bath for another minute to get a little darker. I carefully repeated the process with both sleeves at the same time. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Dip Dye Sweatshirt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Dip%20Dye%20Sweatshirt/dipdye1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Dip Dye Sweatshirt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Dip%20Dye%20Sweatshirt/dipdye3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAfter dying, I ran the sweatshirt under water in the sink until the water ran clear, then I put it right into the washing machine, followed by the dryer. If you want your colors darker, you could easily repeat the dying process. \n\n####What I learned: \n\nThe more solution the better. 10 cups was really the bare minimum. More would have been easier. \n\nBe careful but embrace the imperfections! I thought I had ruined the sweatshirt more than once, but this process is really forgiving. I accidentally touched the side of the pot that must have had a rogue color crystal on it and there was some color transfer onto the part of the sweatshirt that was left undyed. I ended up taking the dye higher than I originally planned to cover it up and other spots faded slightly after washing. \n\nI recommend using a Shout color catcher to collect any dye that may bleed during the first wash. \n\nIn the end, I'm so happy with how this project turned out. I have a comfortable and unique sweatshirt that can be paired with anything from leggings and sneakers to a pencil skirt and heels. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Dip Dye Sweatshirt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Dip%20Dye%20Sweatshirt/finished1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nThanks for having me, fabric.com! \n",

Along the line made from the hoop, sew the trim onto the fabric with the edging pointing in towards the center. \n\nIron a 9\" circle of fusible fleece to the wrong side of the stitchery. Place the 9\" square of muslin on top of the stitchery so right sides are together. Sew all the pieces together, just inside your trim stitching line. \n\nCarefully cut a slit in the muslin, making sure you don't cut the stitchery underneath. Trim the seam to 1/4\" and turn the stitchery right side out through the slit in the muslin. Press. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Flamingo%20Embroidery%20Design%20for%20Cover.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPress the 28\" x 18\" piece of fusible fleece to the wrong side of the 28\" x 18\" outer fabric piece.

Fold the fabric in half, wrong sides together. Sew the two side seams closed with a 1/2\" seam allowance. Repeat for the other pocket. Turn right side out and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Small%20Pocket%20for%20Sewing%20Machine%20Cover.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPress the 9\" x 6\" piece of fusible fleece to one end of the large pocket piece on the wront side. Sew the small pocket in the center along the bottom edge, along each side seam. Sew the trim at the middle point of the fabric, so the top edge of the trim lines up the center point of the fabric.\n\nFold the piece in half, wrong sides together and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Side%20Pockets%20for%20Sewing%20Machine%20Cover.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPlace a pocket piece on each of the side pieces so the bottom edges line up. Sew the sides together with a 1/4\" seam allowance. This will baste the pockets to the side seams but also strengthen the seams.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover%20Side%20Piece.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPin the edges of the main panel along the sides and top edge of the side pieces. You may have to ease the top a bit, just use lots of pins to hold it in place. Sew the seams with a 1/2\" seam allowance. Turn right side out and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Sides%20of%20Sewing%20Machine%20Cover.jpg)\n</p>\n \nSew the lining side pieces to the main lining piece. Leave an opening in one of the side pieces about 7\" wide for turning. Place the lining and outside fabrics right sides together and sew around the bottom edge. Trim the seam.\n\nTurn right side out through the opening in the lining and press. Top stitch the bottom edge, 1/4\" above the seam. Hand sew the lining closed. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Machine Cover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover/Sewing%20Machine%20Cover%20Lining.jpg)\n</p>\n \nIf you like, add a little ribbon bow to the bottom edge of the flamingo embroidery.

Place the 9\" square of muslin on top of the stitchery so right sides are together. Sew all the pieces together, just inside your trim stitching line. </p>\n\n<p>Carefully cut a slit in the muslin, making sure you don't cut the stitchery underneath. Trim the seam to 1/4\" and turn the stitchery right side out through the slit in the muslin.

Leave an opening in one of the side pieces about 7\" wide for turning. Place the lining and outside fabrics right sides together and sew around the bottom edge. Trim the seam.</p>\n\n<p>Turn right side out through the opening in the lining and press. Top stitch the bottom edge, 1/4\" above the seam.

Sara from <a href=\"https://thesaraproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">thesaraproject.com</a>, and back with another great sewing tutorial for you! \n\nHere in Utah, the weather has just hit the 70’s, and I’m in full blown spring mode. As I have been making plans for my spring wardrobe, I’ve noticed that ruffles are having a HUGE moment in the fashion world right now, and I’m obsessed. I’m excited to incorporate this trend into today’s tutorial!\n\nI’ve taken a woven shirt pattern, and altered the pattern to add in two rows of ruffles that run vertically down the front and back sides of the shirt. It’s super simple and super chic. I decided to use a gorgeous Liberty fabric for my top because let’s be honest, Liberty is the essence of spring! Let’s begin!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/styled3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Materials:\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-sara_project_ruffled_top-_-home_page\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric</a>: According to the amount required on your pattern plus a little extra depending on how long your ruffle panels are.

I decided on 5” for my top. Mark this on your pattern piece and draw a vertical line all the way from the shoulder to the bottom hemline of the pattern piece. (You can see my line highlighted in blue). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/Ruffle1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Step 2\nCut along this line we just drew.  Make sure to label your pieces, bodice front and bodice front side panel. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nTape some tracing paper along each inside edge of the blue line just cut and tape. Using a ruler, measure a ½” from each side of the bodice front and bodice front side panel to add a seam allowance to both front bodice pieces. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle5.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nRepeat steps 1-3 for the back bodice piece. \n\n####Step 5\nMark 1” from the bottom hemline on the bodice front/back side panel; this is where we will pin the end of the ruffles, leaving enough room for the bottom hem. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle6.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6\nUsing the tracing paper, now we need to draw out our ruffle panel pieces. I decided to do a double ruffle, the front layer being less wide than the back layer. I also slightly decreased the width on both pieces from the middle of the panels to the hem/bottom edge. \n\na. To figure out how long your panels should be, line up your front and back bodice pieces at the shoulder and measure along the side of edge of both panels. Multiply this number by 2 and you have your length measurement. \n\nb. To decide on the width, play around with how wide you would like your panels to be on your shirt. I decided to make my widest panel 3” wide, and tapered it to 2 ½” at the bottom. My front layer with the smaller width is 2” tapered to 1 1/2”. Once you decide on your width, make sure to add another 1” to both panels width for your seam allowance. You can either draw out the whole length and width of the pattern piece or cut it in half and make sure to cut the pattern out along the fold line going along the grainline to save yourself some time! (This is where you can have some fun. You could do one ruffle panel instead of two, or even make a wider ruffle for a more dramatic look. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle7.jpg)\n</p>\n\n######Now that our pattern pieces are all ready, let’s start sewing!\n\n####Step 1\nPin the bodice front and back at the shoulder seams right sides together and sew. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle8.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 2 \nNext, we need to prep the ruffle panels. Start by finishing the outside edge length wise by ironing the raw straight edge (if you tapered your panels like I did) in ¼”, and then again at ¼”. Repeat for the bottom edges. Topstitch 1/8” along the bottom and one side folded edge to finish. Repeat for all ruffle panel pieces.  On the other side of the ruffle panel (unfinished inside edge), sew two rows of basting stitch at ¼” and ½”, lengthening your stitches to about 4.0, leaving the thread tails long for gathering. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle9.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nOnce your ruffle panels are all prepped, pin the center of the panel to the shoulder seam, and the bottom edges to the edge of the front and back bodice piece (remember to end 1” above the hemline). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle11.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle10.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nNow gently pull on the gathering stitches and evenly space gathers to fit the front and back bodice edge, pinning in place. Repeat to other side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle12.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5\nIf you are doing to layers of ruffle, repeat for the second ruffle layer, pinning directly on top of the first layer of ruffle. Baste the layers to the bodice front and back using a ½” seam allowance. (3 layers in total). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle14.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6\nNow pin and sew the shoulder seams of the front and back bodice side panels right side together. Next, pin the inside edge to the bodice front and back pieces, on top of the two ruffle layers. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle13.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 7\nSew at ½” seam allowance. Iron. When finished it will look like this: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle15.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 8\nNow finish the top according to the pattern instructions. (Sew side seams, set in sleeves, hem sleeves, finish neckline with bias tape or facing).\n\n####Step 9\nLet’s hem our shirt! Fold the raw hem edge in at ½” and the again at a ½”. Topstitch around the folded edge but make sure to start and stop at each ruffle, making sure to fold the ruffle out of the way when needed so that the bottom edge of the ruffle is free when finished. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle16.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAll finished! Thanks for following along! Happy spring and happy sewing, friends! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/styled2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Ruffled Top](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/styled6.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n",

(You can see my line highlighted in blue). </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/Ruffle1.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle2.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step2\">Step 2</h4>\n\n<p>Cut along this line we just drew.  Make sure to label your pieces, bodice front and bodice front side panel. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle3.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step3\">Step 3</h4>\n\n<p>Tape some tracing paper along each inside edge of the blue line just cut and tape. Using a ruler, measure a ½” from each side of the bodice front and bodice front side panel to add a seam allowance to both front bodice pieces. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle4.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle5.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h4>\n\n<p>Repeat steps 1-3 for the back bodice piece. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step5\">Step 5</h4>\n\n<p>Mark 1” from the bottom hemline on the bodice front/back side panel; this is where we will pin the end of the ruffles, leaving enough room for the bottom hem. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle6.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step6\">Step 6</h4>\n\n<p>Using the tracing paper, now we need to draw out our ruffle panel pieces. I decided to do a double ruffle, the front layer being less wide than the back layer. I also slightly decreased the width on both pieces from the middle of the panels to the hem/bottom edge. </p>\n\n<p>a. To figure out how long your panels should be, line up your front and back bodice pieces at the shoulder and measure along the side of edge of both panels. Multiply this number by 2 and you have your length measurement. </p>\n\n<p>b. To decide on the width, play around with how wide you would like your panels to be on your shirt. I decided to make my widest panel 3” wide, and tapered it to 2 ½” at the bottom. My front layer with the smaller width is 2” tapered to 1 1/2”. Once you decide on your width, make sure to add another 1” to both panels width for your seam allowance. You can either draw out the whole length and width of the pattern piece or cut it in half and make sure to cut the pattern out along the fold line going along the grainline to save yourself some time! (This is where you can have some fun. You could do one ruffle panel instead of two, or even make a wider ruffle for a more dramatic look. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle7.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"nowthatourpatternpiecesareallreadyletsstartsewing\">Now that our pattern pieces are all ready, let’s start sewing!</h6>\n\n<h4 id=\"step1\">Step 1</h4>\n\n<p>Pin the bodice front and back at the shoulder seams right sides together and sew. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle8.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step2\">Step 2</h4>\n\n<p>Next, we need to prep the ruffle panels. Start by finishing the outside edge length wise by ironing the raw straight edge (if you tapered your panels like I did) in ¼”, and then again at ¼”. Repeat for the bottom edges. Topstitch 1/8” along the bottom and one side folded edge to finish. Repeat for all ruffle panel pieces.  On the other side of the ruffle panel (unfinished inside edge), sew two rows of basting stitch at ¼” and ½”, lengthening your stitches to about 4.0, leaving the thread tails long for gathering. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle9.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step3\">Step 3</h4>\n\n<p>Once your ruffle panels are all prepped, pin the center of the panel to the shoulder seam, and the bottom edges to the edge of the front and back bodice piece (remember to end 1” above the hemline). </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle11.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle10.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h4>\n\n<p>Now gently pull on the gathering stitches and evenly space gathers to fit the front and back bodice edge, pinning in place. Repeat to other side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle12.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step5\">Step 5</h4>\n\n<p>If you are doing to layers of ruffle, repeat for the second ruffle layer, pinning directly on top of the first layer of ruffle. Baste the layers to the bodice front and back using a ½” seam allowance. (3 layers in total). </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle14.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step6\">Step 6</h4>\n\n<p>Now pin and sew the shoulder seams of the front and back bodice side panels right side together. Next, pin the inside edge to the bodice front and back pieces, on top of the two ruffle layers. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle13.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step7\">Step 7</h4>\n\n<p>Sew at ½” seam allowance. Iron. When finished it will look like this: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle15.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step8\">Step 8</h4>\n\n<p>Now finish the top according to the pattern instructions. (Sew side seams, set in sleeves, hem sleeves, finish neckline with bias tape or facing).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step9\">Step 9</h4>\n\n<p>Let’s hem our shirt! Fold the raw hem edge in at ½” and the again at a ½”. Topstitch around the folded edge but make sure to start and stop at each ruffle, making sure to fold the ruffle out of the way when needed so that the bottom edge of the ruffle is free when finished. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Ruffled%20Top/ruffle16.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffled Top\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>All finished!

Sarah from <a href=\"http://bluesusanmakes.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Susan Makes</a> here. My “baby” just turned 2 and he is busy, busy, busy! Since he can run now and is becoming a little more independent, I don’t need to bring along so many things when we are out and about these days. So, I designed a smaller diaper bag that still has plenty of pockets to help me stay organized.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2035.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIt has a wide base so it stands up easily in the car, and can fit a handful of diapers, toys, snacks, and drinks for a day the park. It has an easy to zip and easy to sew Sport separating zipper as well as handles that are long enough to throw over your shoulder one handed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2036.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMy favorite thing about this bag are the side pockets. They can easily hold water bottles and more, but I like to throw my keys and phone in them so they are easy to grab. The finished dimensions of this bag are 12’’ high x 16’’ wide x 5’’ deep\n\nWant to make one?

This is important to note if you are fussy cutting the fabric or using a directional print.\n\n######From the Exterior fabric cut:\n2 rectangles 10 1/2 ’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the lower exterior panels\n2 rectangles 16’’ x 11’’ for the Exterior pockets (these cuts will be folded widthwise and the top of the pocket will be the fold)\n2 rectangles 12’’ x 10’’ for the interior zipper pocket\n\n######From the Accent fabric cut:\n2 strips 40’’ x 4’’ for the handles and d-ring tabs\n2 strips 3 1/2’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the upper exterior panels\n1 rectangle 6’’x 12’’ for the exterior bottom panel\n\n######From the Lining fabric cut:\n2 rectangles 13’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the lining panels\n2 rectangles 9’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the Large interior pockets\n2 rectangles 12’’ x 7’’ for the small interior pockets\n1 rectangle 6’’x 12’’ for the lining bottom panel \n\n######From the fusible woven interfacing (Shapeflex) cut:\n4 strips 20’’ x 4’’ for the handles and d-ring tabs\n2 rectangles 10 1/2 ’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the lower exterior panels\n2 strips 3 1/2’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the upper exterior panels\n2 rectangles 16’’ x 11’’ for the exterior pockets\n2 rectangles 13’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the lining panels\n2 rectangles 6’’x 12’’ for the exterior and lining bottom panels\n\n######From the Fusible Fleece cut:\n2 strips 1 1/2’’ x 40’’ for the handles\n2 rectangles 10 1/2 ’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the lower exterior panels\n2 strips 3 1/2’’ x 17 1/2’’ for the upper exterior panels\n2 rectangles 8’’ x 11’’ for the exterior pockets\n1 rectangle 6’’x 12’’ for the exterior bottom panel\n\n####Getting Started\nUsing an iron, fuse the woven interfacing to the wrong side of the corresponding fabric pieces according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFuse the Fleece to the upper and lower exterior panels according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n####Make the handles\nFuse 2 strips of interfacing to the wrong side of the handle fabric overlapping it slightly in the center. Fold each long edge toward the center a scant 1/2‘’ with wrong sides together and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%201.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold the handle in half, wrong sides together matching the folded edges. Press. Open the folds and insert a strip of Fusible fleece into one side. Refold the folds and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%202.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTopstitch 1/8 ‘’ away from each folded edge. Cut two 3’’ pieces from one end of the stitched strip to make the D-ring tabs.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%203.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew a 7’’ fold in the center of the handle strip: Find the center. Place a pin 3 1/2’’ away from the center on each side. Fold the handle strip in half lengthwise matching up the topstitched edges. Sew on top of existing stitches between the outer pins. Backstitch at each end.. Repeat for the second handle and set aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%204.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Sew the Exterior panels\nPrepare the D-rings by threading a tab through each ring and basting the tab ends together within the seam allowance. Make 4 altogether.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%205.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace a Lower Exterior Panel right side facing up on the table. Position a d-ring 4 inches away from each side along the top edge. Pin in place. Lay an Upper Exterior Panel, right side facing down, on the lower panel sandwiching the tabs between the 2 panels. Pin in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%206.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew the panels together with a 1/2‘’ seam allowance. Reinforce the tabs by sewing a second line of stitching over them. Press the seam allowance toward the lower panel. Topstitch about 1/8‘’ away from the seam on the lower panel. Repeat for the 2nd panel and set aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%207.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the exterior pockets\n\nFold interfaced Exterior pocket fabric in half widthwise finger press to make a crease down the center. Fuse a piece of Fleece to one half of the wrong side of the pocket. Make sure to use a pressing cloth or fuse the fleece from the fabric side. It’s no fun to melt fleece onto your iron! It is not necessary to fuse the fleece all the way to the edges. We will be cutting some of it away in the next steps. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%208.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold the pocket in half with right sides together and pin the long sides. The fleece should be facing out.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%209.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew the sides and trim the fleece away from the seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2010.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the pocket right side out, push out the corners, and press.Topstitch two rows of stitching 1/4 ‘’ and 1’’ away from the folded edge. Backstitch at the beginning and end of each row. Repeat for the 2nd pocket and set both aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2011.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMake 2 pleats in the bottom, unfinished edge of the pocket. Use 4 pins to mark the edge at 2’’ and 3’’ away from each side. Pinch a fold at each inner pin and bring it to meet the outer pin to form a 1/2‘’ pleat on each side. Pin pleats in place and sew a basting stitch about 3’’ up each pleat. Repeat for the other pocket and set aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2012.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Small inside pockets and the zipper pocket.\nPin the 2 Small Pocket pieces with right sides together. Sew around all 4 sides leaving a 3’’ opening in one side. Trim off each corner. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2013.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the pocket right side out through the opening. Push out the corners with a dull point of a pencil and press the seams flat. Topstitch along one long side about 1/8 ‘’ away from the edge backstitching at each end. \n\nFind the center of the pocket by folding it in half widthwise and finger pressing a crease. Pin the pocket to the center of one lining piece about 5 inches from the top. Stitch around the sides and bottom of the pocket and sew a divider line down the center. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2014.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace a zipper pocket piece on the lining over the pocket. Position it about 1’’ away from the top edge with right sides together. Pin each corner to hold it in place. Draw a rectangle on the zipper pocket piece using a pen as follows: \n\nDraw a 9’’ line 2’’ below the top edge of the zipper pocket piece and in the center. Draw a second 9’’ line 3/8 ‘’ below the first one. Connect the 2 lines on each side to make a rectangle. These will be your stitch lines.(blue in the photo)  Draw another line between the two lines with a little “Y” on each end.This will be your cut line (red in the photo).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2015.jpg)\n</p>\n\nStitch around the outer rectangle right on the line. Using sharp pointed scissors, cut along the center line and into the corners being careful not to cut the stitches. Push the pocket fabric through the cut window, push out the seams and corners, and press. Trim any excess zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2016.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith the right side of the lining window facing up, position the zipper under the opening with the zipper teeth facing up. I like putting the zipper pull on the left side when closed. If your zipper is longer than the opening position it so that the zipper stop is just inside one end of the window and let the extra extend past the other side.Pin the zipper in place.\n\nSew around the window about 1/8 ‘’ away from the edge. Be careful as you sew through the zipper teeth on one side. Just take it slow and advance the stitches by using your hand wheel to make sure your needle doesn’t break. Trim any excess zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2017.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the lining piece over and pin the 2nd Zipper Pocket piece to the 1st piece with right sides together. Make sure to pin just the pocket pieces together and avoid pinning the lining. Sew all the way around the pocket folding the lining out of the way as you sew. Set this piece aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2018.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Large inside pockets\nPlace the 2 Large Interior Pocket pieces together and sew 1 long side. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2019.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the pocket pieces right side out matching wrong sides together. Press the seam flat. Sew a line of stitches 1/8‘’ away from the seam edge. Fold the Pocket in half to find the center. Pin the Pocket to the lower half of the remaining Lining piece. Baste the pocket along the sides and bottom. And set aside\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/photo%2020.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Install the zipper closure \n\nUsing a marking pen or chalk make a mark the back side of the zipper tape on one of the ends. This will make it easier to remember which is the back side once you’ve separated the zipper. Unzip the zipper all the way and place one zipper half face down along the top of an exterior piece. Center the zipper so there is about 3/4’’ on each side. Fold the top zipper tape end out an angle into the seam allowance toward the lining side. Place a lining piece face down on top of the exterior piece sandwiching the zipper. Match the edges and pin in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2021.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUsing a zipper foot, Sew along the edge with a 1/4 ‘’ seam allowance. Open up the piece and press the seam open a few inches on each side.\n\nInstall the other half of the zipper between the other lining and exterior pieces.  Make sure the zipper tape direction lines up properly so that the zipper tops and bottoms will line up correctly when zipped together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2022.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Install the Exterior pockets\nAt this point we will take advantage of being able to open this panel and lay it flat to make it easier to sew the pocket on. The next pocket will be a little trickier to install.\n\nLay both parts of the bag together, with right sides facing, matching the lining to the lining and the exterior to the exterior. Pin one long side. Make sure to line up the zipper seams with seams pressed open, as well as the exterior panel seams. Sew along the edge with a 1/2 ‘’ seam. It may be necessary to use a zipper foot to sew next to the zipper ends. \n\nTrim a little triangle out of the seam where the zipper seams come together to reduce bulk and press the side seam open. Before sewing the second side seam install the first Exterior pocket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2023.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLay the exterior panels face up on the table. Find the center bottom edge of a prepared exterior pocket and match it to the side seam of of the exterior panels. Pin the lower edge in place.\n\nUsing the corner of a ruler, pin the sides of the pocket to the panel so they are perpendicular to the bottom edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2024.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTopstitch around all three sides 1/8’’ from the edge. Leave the pleat basting stitches in for now.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2025.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold the panels so that right sides are together again as in step 1. Pin and sew the 2nd side seam. Trim a triangle out of the zipper seam. Press the side seam open. You should now have a big tube.\n\nTurn the tube right side out. Slide the exterior end over the end of an ironing board. Pin the 2nd prepared exterior pocket in place just like the first one. I like to slide my ruler underneath the bag as I pin so that I don’t pin it to the ironing board fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2026.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCarefully turn the tube inside out again. Sew along the bottom edge of the pocket to keep it in place. Position the bottom of the pocket under the sewing machine and topstitch one side of the pocket from the bottom to the top.  Backstitch 3-4 times at the top of the pocket. Repeat for the other side of the pocket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2027.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Install the Bottom Panel\nFind the center of each side of the exterior bottom panel. Find the center of the bottom edge of the Exterior Panels by matching the side seams and marking the fold on each side. With right sides together match the center on the long sides of the bottom panel to the center on the Exterior panels. Pin along each long side.  Sew a 1/2’’ seam all the way through the end of each side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2028.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLine up the bottom panel against the Exterior side seam and pin the center in place. If the Exterior panel fabric is a little longer than the bottom panel that is ok. Just make sure the difference is lining up straight. Pinch the corners so they lay flat. Pin and stitch with a 1/2’’ seam allowance. Repeat for the opposite side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2029.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat these steps to install the lining bottom panel, but this time leave a 4-5’’ opening in the center of one long side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2030.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Finishing touches\nTurn the bag right side out through the opening in the lining. Fold the raw edges of the opening to the inside and stitch the opening closed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2031.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPush the lining to the inside and press along the edge of the zipper so the seam lays flat. Be careful to never put the iron on the zipper teeth, they will melt. Topstitch around the zipper seam about 1/8’’ away from the edge. Now you can thread the 2 zipper tapes together and zip up the bag. It’s coming together and looking so good!\n\nUnpick the basting stitches from the side pockets.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2033.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFinally, attach the handles by threading an end through the d-ring, folding it over 1/2’’ and then 1 1/5’’. Sew 2 rows of stitching through the folds. Repeat for the rest of the d-rings and 2nd handle. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2034.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy Sewing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Title%205.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Diaper Bag](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Title%204.jpg)\n</p>\n",

Fuse a piece of Fleece to one half of the wrong side of the pocket. Make sure to use a pressing cloth or fuse the fleece from the fabric side. It’s no fun to melt fleece onto your iron! It is not necessary to fuse the fleece all the way to the edges.

Use 4 pins to mark the edge at 2’’ and 3’’ away from each side. Pinch a fold at each inner pin and bring it to meet the outer pin to form a 1/2‘’ pleat on each side. Pin pleats in place and sew a basting stitch about 3’’ up each pleat.

Push out the corners with a dull point of a pencil and press the seams flat. Topstitch along one long side about 1/8 ‘’ away from the edge backstitching at each end. </p>\n\n<p>Find the center of the pocket by folding it in half widthwise and finger pressing a crease. Pin the pocket to the center of one lining piece about 5 inches from the top. Stitch around the sides and bottom of the pocket and sew a divider line down the center. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2014.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Place a zipper pocket piece on the lining over the pocket. Position it about 1’’ away from the top edge with right sides together. Pin each corner to hold it in place. Draw a rectangle on the zipper pocket piece using a pen as follows: </p>\n\n<p>Draw a 9’’ line 2’’ below the top edge of the zipper pocket piece and in the center. Draw a second 9’’ line 3/8 ‘’ below the first one. Connect the 2 lines on each side to make a rectangle. These will be your stitch lines.(blue in the photo)  Draw another line between the two lines with a little “Y” on each end.This will be your cut line (red in the photo).</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2015.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Stitch around the outer rectangle right on the line. Using sharp pointed scissors, cut along the center line and into the corners being careful not to cut the stitches. Push the pocket fabric through the cut window, push out the seams and corners, and press. Trim any excess zipper tape.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2016.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>With the right side of the lining window facing up, position the zipper under the opening with the zipper teeth facing up. I like putting the zipper pull on the left side when closed. If your zipper is longer than the opening position it so that the zipper stop is just inside one end of the window and let the extra extend past the other side.Pin the zipper in place.</p>\n\n<p>Sew around the window about 1/8 ‘’ away from the edge. Be careful as you sew through the zipper teeth on one side. Just take it slow and advance the stitches by using your hand wheel to make sure your needle doesn’t break. Trim any excess zipper tape.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2017.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Turn the lining piece over and pin the 2nd Zipper Pocket piece to the 1st piece with right sides together. Make sure to pin just the pocket pieces together and avoid pinning the lining. Sew all the way around the pocket folding the lining out of the way as you sew. Set this piece aside.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2018.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"makethelargeinsidepockets\">Make the Large inside pockets</h4>\n\n<p>Place the 2 Large Interior Pocket pieces together and sew 1 long side. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2019.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Turn the pocket pieces right side out matching wrong sides together. Press the seam flat. Sew a line of stitches 1/8‘’ away from the seam edge. Fold the Pocket in half to find the center. Pin the Pocket to the lower half of the remaining Lining piece. Baste the pocket along the sides and bottom. And set aside</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/photo%2020.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"installthezipperclosure\">Install the zipper closure</h4>\n\n<p>Using a marking pen or chalk make a mark the back side of the zipper tape on one of the ends. This will make it easier to remember which is the back side once you’ve separated the zipper. Unzip the zipper all the way and place one zipper half face down along the top of an exterior piece. Center the zipper so there is about 3/4’’ on each side. Fold the top zipper tape end out an angle into the seam allowance toward the lining side. Place a lining piece face down on top of the exterior piece sandwiching the zipper. Match the edges and pin in place.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2021.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Using a zipper foot, Sew along the edge with a 1/4 ‘’ seam allowance. Open up the piece and press the seam open a few inches on each side.</p>\n\n<p>Install the other half of the zipper between the other lining and exterior pieces.  Make sure the zipper tape direction lines up properly so that the zipper tops and bottoms will line up correctly when zipped together.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2022.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"installtheexteriorpockets\">Install the Exterior pockets</h4>\n\n<p>At this point we will take advantage of being able to open this panel and lay it flat to make it easier to sew the pocket on. The next pocket will be a little trickier to install.</p>\n\n<p>Lay both parts of the bag together, with right sides facing, matching the lining to the lining and the exterior to the exterior. Pin one long side. Make sure to line up the zipper seams with seams pressed open, as well as the exterior panel seams. Sew along the edge with a 1/2 ‘’ seam. It may be necessary to use a zipper foot to sew next to the zipper ends. </p>\n\n<p>Trim a little triangle out of the seam where the zipper seams come together to reduce bulk and press the side seam open. Before sewing the second side seam install the first Exterior pocket.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2023.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Lay the exterior panels face up on the table. Find the center bottom edge of a prepared exterior pocket and match it to the side seam of of the exterior panels. Pin the lower edge in place.</p>\n\n<p>Using the corner of a ruler, pin the sides of the pocket to the panel so they are perpendicular to the bottom edge.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2024.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Topstitch around all three sides 1/8’’ from the edge. Leave the pleat basting stitches in for now.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2025.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Fold the panels so that right sides are together again as in step 1. Pin and sew the 2nd side seam. Trim a triangle out of the zipper seam. Press the side seam open. You should now have a big tube.</p>\n\n<p>Turn the tube right side out. Slide the exterior end over the end of an ironing board. Pin the 2nd prepared exterior pocket in place just like the first one. I like to slide my ruler underneath the bag as I pin so that I don’t pin it to the ironing board fabric.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2026.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Carefully turn the tube inside out again. Sew along the bottom edge of the pocket to keep it in place. Position the bottom of the pocket under the sewing machine and topstitch one side of the pocket from the bottom to the top.  Backstitch 3-4 times at the top of the pocket. Repeat for the other side of the pocket.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2027.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"installthebottompanel\">Install the Bottom Panel</h4>\n\n<p>Find the center of each side of the exterior bottom panel. Find the center of the bottom edge of the Exterior Panels by matching the side seams and marking the fold on each side. With right sides together match the center on the long sides of the bottom panel to the center on the Exterior panels. Pin along each long side.  Sew a 1/2’’ seam all the way through the end of each side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2028.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Line up the bottom panel against the Exterior side seam and pin the center in place. If the Exterior panel fabric is a little longer than the bottom panel that is ok. Just make sure the difference is lining up straight. Pinch the corners so they lay flat. Pin and stitch with a 1/2’’ seam allowance. Repeat for the opposite side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2029.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Repeat these steps to install the lining bottom panel, but this time leave a 4-5’’ opening in the center of one long side.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2030.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"finishingtouches\">Finishing touches</h4>\n\n<p>Turn the bag right side out through the opening in the lining. Fold the raw edges of the opening to the inside and stitch the opening closed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2031.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Push the lining to the inside and press along the edge of the zipper so the seam lays flat. Be careful to never put the iron on the zipper teeth, they will melt. Topstitch around the zipper seam about 1/8’’ away from the edge. Now you can thread the 2 zipper tapes together and zip up the bag. It’s coming together and looking so good!</p>\n\n<p>Unpick the basting stitches from the side pockets.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2033.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Finally, attach the handles by threading an end through the d-ring, folding it over 1/2’’ and then 1 1/5’’. Sew 2 rows of stitching through the folds. Repeat for the rest of the d-rings and 2nd handle. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Photo%2034.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy Sewing!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Title%205.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Blue%20Susan%20Makes%20Diaper%20Bag/Title%204.jpg\" alt=\"Diaper Bag\" />\n</p>",

I sewed the two squares together with a ½ seam allowance, along 3 sides, leaving the bottom side open. I clipped the corners and flipped it inside out, stuffed down the pillow form to allow extra fabric to topstitch the bottom seam closed.

Note- this fabric does not supply a full alphabet, but a ½ yard gets you enough options to form some desirable words. I cut a ½’’ border around the letters I wanted to form the word “love.” and the phrase “oh, hi.” I love the results of the lettering on the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456717/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-canvas-rosa-floral-natural?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-rifle_paper_rosa\" target=\"_blank\">Rifle Paper Co. floral linen blend</a>; the white almost looks electric. These finished pillows measure about 20” x 20”. For each pillow, I cut 2 squares of the fabric measuring 21” x 21” to give a ½” seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI positioned where I wanted the letters to be, pinned them, and used a concentrated zig zag topstitch to applique on:\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFollowing the enclosing method mentioned in the summary, this image shows how I’ve stuffed the pillow form down and pinned, to allow extra fabric to work with as I topstitch the seam closed: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce the cover was sealed, I fluffed the pillow: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/5.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Feather Pillows:\nThis <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430508/premier-prints-feather-silhouette-twill-white-coral?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-feathers\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints fabric</a> has coral feathers printed allover, so I wanted to cut them out and form new patterns and designs by piecing them on other fabrics. These finished pillows measure about 16” x 16”, so I cut two 17” squares of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458773/waverly-strands-jacquard-tuxedo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-strands\" target=\"_blank\">Waverly fabric</a> that balance the black and white pattern, so that it would be centered on the pillow. I cut out 18 feathers with a ¼’’ white border, and positioned them strategically in the jacquard design of this Waverly fabric. \n\nThis pillow plays directly off the pattern in the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458773/waverly-strands-jacquard-tuxedo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-strands\" target=\"_blank\">Waverly fabric</a>; the feathers and the design line up just right, so visually, it’s like creating a whole new fabric! I used a concentrated zig zag topstitch along the white border with metallic gold thread.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/6.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/7.jpg)\n</p>\n \nThe feathers also resembled that of flower petals, so I cut out about 20 and positioned them till I had a flower blossom shape I liked based off the exact center of the square. I pinned the outer layer of the feather first, pinned and stitched them with metallic gold thread. I straight stitched within the borders of the feathers, as well as stitched randomly on the feather, creating an abstract grain look. For the center, I just folded over a feather and top stitched. Tip: make sure your machine is well oiled! This particular pillow was a bit tedious, but well worth it. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/8.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/9.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/10.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/11.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Aztec Pillow:\nThis pillow is so easy and so on-trend! For each pillow, I cut 17” x 17” squares of this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0441912/kaufman-essex-yarn-dyed-linen-blend-metallic-camel?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-essex_camel\" target=\"_blank\">metallic linen blend</a> fabric, so that the finished size would be 16” x 16”. I cut 10 triangles out of faux suede black fabric, and positioned them on the gold linen square. \n\nI experimented with a few different kinds of triangles and different shapes, landing on 2 designs. I pinned the design down and topstitched ¼”around all the borders. I even added a stitch design just to give a little something extra. Like the other applique pillows, this faux suede will have some shedding, so just pull and trim the threads as they unravel a little.   \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/12.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/13.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/14.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/15.jpg)\n</p>\n  \n####Patchwork Pillow:\nTo me, this is the wow-factor pillow. This pillow was inspired by a pillow Anthropologie carried years ago, and I just loved it. To create my own version of it, I played with the leftover fabric I had from the piece pillows as well as some fabric I had in my stash. \n\nDepending on the size of the pillow you wanted to make, determines how usable the leftover pieces are. I wanted a rectangular pillow and used fiber fill to make it a custom size of 15” x 20”.\n\n######The fabric I used for this pillow:\n* Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458773/waverly-strands-jacquard-tuxedo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-strands\" target=\"_blank\">Waverly Strands fabric</a>. I had just enough left off my original 1 yard piece to create a section on the front and used it as the backing. I also cut the selvedges off to create the fringe on the sides. \n* Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456717/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-canvas-rosa-floral-natural?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-rifle_paper_rosa\" target=\"_blank\">Rifle Paper Co. floral fabric</a>\n* Cut some more feathers out of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430508/premier-prints-feather-silhouette-twill-white-coral?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-feathers\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints fabric</a> \n* Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0441912/kaufman-essex-yarn-dyed-linen-blend-metallic-camel?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-essex_camel\" target=\"_blank\">gold linen blend</a> fabric from the Aztec pillows.\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-xoxo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-cotton_steel_xoxo\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Xoxo fabric</a> from my quilting cotton stash. This color way is no longer available, however, there are still more colors available for this style.\n* Also from my stash, this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0482616/charlotte-moss-menton-linen-blend-coral?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-charlotte_moss_butterflies\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Moss linen fabric</a>\n\nI drew this basic design out and started layering the fabrics on each other, designing what I wanted the order and shapes to be. The best part about this pillow design is that it doesn’t have to be perfect! Anything goes. I started by free hand drawing a zig zag in pencil on the back of the XoXo fabric: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/16.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI followed the same line and cut the butterfly fabric to match: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/17.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI cut a few more feathers out, but this time cutting all the way to the print to avoid any white borders. I also wanted the points to be included in the seam allowances. I layered and played with the fabrics till I got the look I wanted, and started pinning and sewing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/18.jpg)\n</p>\n \nI cut the black and white fabric to follow the wave pattern, and pinned my layers together. Top stitching with a ¼’’ allowance: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/19.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/20.jpg)\n</p>\n\n \nFor each layer, I trimmed the back as I went to reduce bulk:  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/21.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/22.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI used a variety of topstitches with aqua thread, as shown. I picked a zig zag stitch for the jacquard fabric to secure it a bit more. Like all the other pillows, there will be some fraying and a “shedding” period, but overtime, I want the frayed look to add texture to the pillows: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/23.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/24.jpg)\n</p>\n \nOnce I had patched the front of the pillow together, I used a leftover piece of the black and white fabric for the back, but I used the opposite side. I also cut the selvedge off of the black and white fabric to use as fringe on 2 sides of the pillow:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/25.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFor enclosing this pillow, I wanted to hand stitch it closed. So I left a very small opening along the black and white fabric portion, so that my stitches would be better concealed within the jacquard fabric:\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/26.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI used a ½ seam allowance, clipped the corners and flipped it inside out. I carefully stuffed the pillows with fiber fill and hand stitched the opening closed using a slip stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/27.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/28.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce closed, mold and fluff your pillows to get the fiber fill settled.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/29.jpg)\n</p>\n \nAnd done! Seven coordinating pillows that combine unique elements from each fabric. Enjoy!\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Patch Piece Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/31.jpg)\n</p>  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Like the other applique pillows, this faux suede will have some shedding, so just pull and trim the threads as they unravel a little.   </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/12.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/13.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/14.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/15.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"patchworkpillow\">Patchwork Pillow:</h4>\n\n<p>To me, this is the wow-factor pillow. This pillow was inspired by a pillow Anthropologie carried years ago, and I just loved it. To create my own version of it, I played with the leftover fabric I had from the piece pillows as well as some fabric I had in my stash. </p>\n\n<p>Depending on the size of the pillow you wanted to make, determines how usable the leftover pieces are. I wanted a rectangular pillow and used fiber fill to make it a custom size of 15” x 20”.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"thefabriciusedforthispillow\">The fabric I used for this pillow:</h6>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458773/waverly-strands-jacquard-tuxedo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-strands\" target=\"_blank\">Waverly Strands fabric</a>. I had just enough left off my original 1 yard piece to create a section on the front and used it as the backing. I also cut the selvedges off to create the fringe on the sides. </li>\n<li>Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456717/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-canvas-rosa-floral-natural?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-rifle_paper_rosa\" target=\"_blank\">Rifle Paper Co. floral fabric</a></li>\n<li>Cut some more feathers out of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430508/premier-prints-feather-silhouette-twill-white-coral?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-feathers\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints fabric</a> </li>\n<li>Leftover <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0441912/kaufman-essex-yarn-dyed-linen-blend-metallic-camel?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-essex_camel\" target=\"_blank\">gold linen blend</a> fabric from the Aztec pillows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-xoxo?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-patch_piece_pillows-_-cotton_steel_xoxo\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Xoxo fabric</a> from my quilting cotton stash.

The best part about this pillow design is that it doesn’t have to be perfect! Anything goes. I started by free hand drawing a zig zag in pencil on the back of the XoXo fabric: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/16.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I followed the same line and cut the butterfly fabric to match: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/17.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I cut a few more feathers out, but this time cutting all the way to the print to avoid any white borders. I also wanted the points to be included in the seam allowances. I layered and played with the fabrics till I got the look I wanted, and started pinning and sewing!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/18.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I cut the black and white fabric to follow the wave pattern, and pinned my layers together. Top stitching with a ¼’’ allowance: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/19.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/20.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For each layer, I trimmed the back as I went to reduce bulk:  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/21.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/22.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I used a variety of topstitches with aqua thread, as shown. I picked a zig zag stitch for the jacquard fabric to secure it a bit more. Like all the other pillows, there will be some fraying and a “shedding” period, but overtime, I want the frayed look to add texture to the pillows: </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/23.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/24.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Once I had patched the front of the pillow together, I used a leftover piece of the black and white fabric for the back, but I used the opposite side. I also cut the selvedge off of the black and white fabric to use as fringe on 2 sides of the pillow:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/25.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For enclosing this pillow, I wanted to hand stitch it closed. So I left a very small opening along the black and white fabric portion, so that my stitches would be better concealed within the jacquard fabric:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/26.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I used a ½ seam allowance, clipped the corners and flipped it inside out. I carefully stuffed the pillows with fiber fill and hand stitched the opening closed using a slip stitch.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/27.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/28.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Once closed, mold and fluff your pillows to get the fiber fill settled.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/29.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>And done! Seven coordinating pillows that combine unique elements from each fabric. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Patch%20%26%20Piece%20Pillows/31.jpg\" alt=\"Patch Piece Pillows\" />\n</p>  ",

I know it’s ultra-comfortable for little ones and a one-stop-shop for a quick outfit. \n\nIn this tutorial, I’ll provide step by step instructions to create your own pattern and construct a baby/toddler romper. While the construction of the romper itself is an advanced sewist project that requires the use of a serger, the custom pattern making process can be applied to any project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/1%20edit.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Supplies:\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tri-blend-heather-jersey-knit?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-knit_baby_romper-_-tri_blend_knits\" target=\"_blank\">Tri-Blend Jersey Knit</a> (I used Grey, Royal and the light heather grey)\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-laguna-cotton-jersey-knit?cm_mmc=Blog-_-Links-_-knit_baby_romper-_-laguna_jersey\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Laguna Jersey Knit</a>, I used Navy, Pepper or Onyx for ribbing and cuffs. \n* 4 or 5 thread Serger\n* Paper for pattern\n* Clothes for pattern template\n\n####Making the pattern:\nDress your child in a T-shirt and pants that fit comfortably. Measure where the T-shirt hem falls in regards to the pants waistband. Measure on the side for best accuracy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUse the T-shirt and pants as a template for a pattern. For pattern paper, I used 3 sheets of printer paper taped together. Turn the pants and shirt inside out. Find the center of the front of the T-shirt and align it with one side of the paper. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/5.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/6.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTrace around the shirt. Most knit apparel items have a ¼’’ seam allowance for serged seams, which is what I used in this project as well. To account for the arm holes, I used a sewing pin to poke through along the T-shirt arm hole seam. When you remove the shirt, you can simply connect the series of pinpoints to trace the correct armhole curve. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/7.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/8.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the neck curve, I did the same because I did not include the neck ribbing. \n\nI placed the pants so that the overlap with the shirt would be 3 ¼’’, according to my measurement I took earlier when my son was wearing the clothes.  Placing the center of the pants along the edge of the paper with the T-shirt tracing, I used the same technique to trace the pants.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/9.jpg)\n</p>\n\n Once I had it traced, I drew a logical line between the armpit and the let opening. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/10.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor this romper, I wanted the look of a drop-crotch, so I decreased the inseam by lowering the crotch line about 1”.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/11.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the back pattern piece, I used the front pattern piece to trace as a template. I then extended the length of the shoulder seam, as the T-shirt does. I measured it on the T-shirt and applied it to the pattern. I extended it another ¼’’ to add a seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/12.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/13.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/14.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI also lowered the curve for the crotch seam to allow for a slight curve of a baby bottom. This isn’t totally necessary, but it will make the garment lay slightly better along the bottom. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/15.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis romper has no closures, no snaps to mess with, Velcro, or buttons. So how are you supposed to dress your child in it or do a quick diaper change? The secret here is in a super stretchy neck. The neck has to be wide enough for your baby’s shoulders and hips to go through comfortably, and the fabric has to have enough spandex to bounce back and not loose shape or pop the seam. \n\nTo get a larger neck opening, I sketched a lower neckline and cut down both the front and the back pattern by about 1 ¼’’ each. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/16.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/17.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe fabric I picked for this romper is this very lightweight tri-blend jersey knit. It would be perfect for the summer so my toddler would be comfortable and cool. Although it has some mechanical stretch, there’s no spandex in that fabric, but there is spandex in the Kaufman Laguna Jersey Knit I chose for the ribbing and cuffs, which is what will make this garment functional. \n\nFor the ribbing, I cut three 1 ½’’ x 14” strips, on grain, of the Kaufman Laguna Jersey Knit.\n\nFor the cuffs, I traced the cuffs from the template pants, but I wanted a longer cuff, so I added 2”. This made for a 6 ½” x 5” rectangle. Cut 2 of the Laguna Jersey Knit, on grain. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/18.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/19.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/20.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Construction:\nAs mentioned, this is for advanced sewists, preferably familiar with sewing knit garments. If you are new to sewing knit garments on a serger, this is a great intro project. Always use a scrap piece of fabric to test the stitch, tension and stretch. I used a 4-thread overlock setting.  \n\n#####Step 1:\nRight sides together, serge 1 shoulder seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/21.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 2:\nTo attach the ribbing to the neck line: Fold one of the 1 ½’’ x 15’’ strips in half, wrong sides together. Romper face up, right sides together, raw edges together, begin serging the neck ribbing on.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/22.jpg)\n</p> \n\nKEY: as you attach the ribbing, gently stretch the folded strip as you serge. This will make the garment lay better. If you don’t stretch the ribbing as you go, the neckline will gape; if you pull it too much, the neck will be too tight and the fabric will gather. If you have not done this technique before, practice on a spare piece of fabric until you are comfortable. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/23.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/24.jpg)\n</p> \n\nTrim any access ribbing and serge the other shoulder seam, right sides together. \n\nTIP: use a regular sewing machine to straight stitch the ribbing of the seam before serging, to avoid any crawling the fabric will do that could cause mismatched seams. \n\n#####Step 3:\nSerge both arm hole ribbings using the same technique as step 2.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/25.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step 4:\nRight sides together, serge both side seams.\n\n#####Step 5:\nSerge the inseam.\n\n####Step 6:\nPants cuff: for each one, fold it “hotdog” style, and serge the side. Flip inside out so that the cuff has a folded edge, right sides are showing, and raw edges are together, ready to be attached to the leg opening of the romper.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/26.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step 7:\nRight sides and raw edges together, serge the cuffs to the leg openings. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/27.jpg)\n</p> \n\n#####Step 8:\nFor finishing, trim your serge threads around each seam, and top stitch the seam with a regular machine to secure the seam on the ribbings.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/28.jpg)\n</p> \n\nPoof! Done! The most adorable, comfortable romper for your little one. For longevity and quality, wash on a gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. For a more durable fabric, I’d recommend any of these stretch cotton jersey knits. \n\nFor a shorts version, measure where your child’s knee is, and add a line to your pattern pieces. For the back pattern piece, I made a slight convex curve for a better fit on the leg opening. For the leg opening ribbing, I cut two 12’’ x 2” strips of the Laguna jersey knit, and used the same technique as step 2, and finishing technique from step 8. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/29.jpg)\n</p>\n\nEnjoy!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Baby Romper](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Baby%20Romper/hero2.jpg)\n</p>\n",

Not sure how <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> differ? Let’s find out!\n\nTo understand which fabric will meet your needs, you first need to really understand what <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> and canvas are. Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> is actually a type of canvas? Both fabrics are plain-weave, are made from cotton and are incredibly versatile. The main difference between <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a> lies in thread count. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">Canvas</a> is known for its coarser weave, while duck boasts a smooth hand thanks to its high thread count. You can see here the difference in weave in canvas (left) vs. duck (right).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Canvas vs. Duck](http://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Canvas%20vs.%20Duck/side_by_side.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIdentifying <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a> is fairly easy. We classify our fabrics based on a weight system of ounces per square yard; the higher the ounce weight, the heavier the fabric. Browsing through fabric.com, you’ll notice that canvas comes in heavier weights such as medium/heavyweight to very heavyweight, whereas <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> will be more in the medium weight range.\n\nWhen it comes to projects, both plain and duck canvas give you a wide variety of options. You can use plain canvas and duck fabric for everything from durable clothing to accessories. Here are some suggestions for projects which are perfect for duck and plain canvas fabrics, featuring finished projects created by fabric.com customers:\n\n#####Baby carriers & stroller covers\nBaby carriers and stroller covers are a prime example of the balance between strength and softness.  Here’s a great project one of our customers  created for her stroller using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0528864/premier-prints-llama-love-sundown\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Llama Love</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0528893/premier-prints-strike-sundown\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Strike Sundown</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Canvas vs. Duck](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Canvas%20vs.%20Duck/customer%20photo-%20baby%20carrier.jpg)\n</p>\n \n#####Lunch bags\nNo need to spend money at the store when you can make your own bag using one of our gorgeous patterns. You can personalize it even more with a monogram!\n\n#####Homemade canvases\nTraditional art canvases can be expensive – why not make your own? You can even combine small pieces of canvas with Popsicle sticks to make tiny pieces of art. Simply use hot glue to combine four sticks into a mini frame, let dry, and then wrap a small piece of canvas around the sticks, giving you a miniature canvas that you can use for playing with kids or handing out your own artistic creations.\n\n#####Window treatments\nCurtains and other window treatments can be one of the most expensive home decor projects. With fabric from fabric.com, you can design something unique while also saving money.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Canvas vs. Duck](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Canvas%20vs.%20Duck/13697078_10104183724489655_2923431440519113627_n.jpg)\n</p>\n\n \n#####Headboards\nHeadboards are an enjoyable project that let you personalize your living space. With canvas fabric, you can create something that is just your style without spending a fortune.\n\n#####Tote bags\nTote bags are a great choice, especially for duck fabrics. You can make a full-size tote with just a yard of fabric, making them a simple, cost-effective project. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Canvas vs. Duck](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Canvas%20vs.%20Duck/tote.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIf you’re creating one of the above projects, feel free to choose whichever fabric type you prefer! We stock everything from plain canvas to beautifully patterned duck, so finding the perfect fabric to create something beautiful should be a piece of cake! \n\nBecause <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a> is a heavier weight fabric, is can be used for projects that will see quite a bit of wear and tear. This includes anything from shoes and duffle bags to sturdy backpacks and aprons. If you’re looking for an even more durable <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a>, rhino canvas and sailcloth—made with synthetic fibers—are a great option. Our personal favorite, however, is <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=waxed+canvas\" target=\"_blank\">waxed canvas</a>. It’s made from cotton fibers and treated with paraffin wax to add a cool look and feel as well as built in water repellency. \n\nCanvas is great for heavier projects, but cotton <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> works well for a lot of projects due to its lighter weight. Not only is it lighter and with a smoother hand, it’s much more pliable and easy to work with than canvas. These properties make it perfect for handbags and totes, draperies, light upholstery and even anorak jackets and blazers. The options are almost endless!\n  \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Canvas vs. Duck](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Canvas%20vs.%20Duck/dsc_0178-003.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe are happy to carry a vast selection of high-quality canvas and duck fabrics in a wide variety of colors and styles so that you can create something truly unique.

If you’re hoping to create a masterpiece, you need quality tools to help get you there. In the sewing world, this means a fully stocked basket of sewing accessories. Whether you’re a novice sewist or a pro looking to simplify your craft, we’ve got a few tips on the best tools to use.\n\nBelieve it or not, sewing accessories haven’t always been around; they were a result of seamstress’ trying to simplify their trade. And so with the invention of the sewing machine came other tools to help make sewing less cumbersome. These handy tools were created with sewists in mind, to address well known problems and some you may not even have encountered yet!\n\n####1. Needle Threader\nEven the most experienced sewists fumble with threading a needle from time to time, which is why there is a multitude of threading tools meant to make this an easy process. Desk <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-580/clover-ultimate-needle-threader\" target=\"_blank\">needle threaders</a> tend to be the most effective as you simply drop your needle in (any size except tiny quilt petites), rest your thread in the slot and press the button. The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-580/clover-ultimate-needle-threader\" target=\"_blank\">Clover Ultimate Needle Threader</a> is our favorite and, quite honestly, a must-have for anyone looking to simplify the needle threading process.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![5 Handy Sewing Accessories](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-580_needle_threader.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####2. Frixion Pens\nThese clever pens have a huge following and, if you’ve ever used one, you’ll understand why. They can draw on both fabric and paper patterns and they utilize a gel that erases with heat. Simply draw out what you need and then iron away the evidence! If you’re going to go this route, we suggest the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0375099/pilot-frixion-ball-erasable-gel-pens-8pkg-assorted-colors\" target=\"_blank\">Pilot FriXion Ball Erasable Gel Pens</a> as they’re easy to use and get the job done.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![5 Handy Sewing Accessories](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/0375099_gel_pens.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####3. Pattern Weights\nEver try to cut a pattern from a delicate fabric only to realize that the pins snagged the fabric? Us too! Pattern weights are great as they allow you to cut patterns without the pins. We highly recommend these <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-2204/dritz-4-pattern-weights\" target=\"_blank\">Dritz Pattern Weights</a> if you use patterns often.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![5 Handy Sewing Accessories](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-2204_pattern_weights.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####4. Acrylic Ruler\nStraight and accurate cuts are crucial parts of any project, but they can also be hard to achieve. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rulers\" target=\"_blank\">Acrylic rulers</a> make this easy, especially when used with a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?product-type=rotary-blades\" target=\"_blank\">rotary cutter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?product-type=mats\" target=\"_blank\">cutting mat</a>. Our personal favorite ruler is the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-451/olipfa-ruler-with-lip-edge-5x24\" target=\"_blank\">O’lipfa Ruler with Lip Edge</a> as its size (5” x 24”) makes long cuts possible and it features a unique lip edge that keeps the ruler straight on the edge of the mat.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![5 Handy Sewing Accessories](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-451_olipfa_ruler.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####5. Seam ripper\nRipping seams can be quite frustrating and time consuming, which is why a good seam ripper made our list of must-haves. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0488106/tula-pink-55-surgical-seam-ripper\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink's Surgical Seam Ripper</a> is a popular choice amongst sewists as it features a sharp blade instead of the normal tip and is a quick way to rip out stitches.\n\nThis seam ripper is part of the overall <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tula-pink-limited-edition-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink Limited Edition Tools</a> line, which also includes shears, micro-tip scissors, and a number of other tools designed to provide utility and style. The gorgeous coloring on these stainless steel <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tula-pink-limited-edition-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink</a> products provides second to none style for your sewing room.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![5 Handy Sewing Accessories](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_0488106_tula_pink_seam_ripper.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nIf you thought that all you needed to accomplish your goal was your sewing machine, then you have been missing out! Having the right sewing accessories can reduce headaches and encourage you to pick up those projects you have been putting off. Plus, these products make wonderful gifts for someone new to the craft, making it easy to pass your love for sewing on to someone else! \n\n\n",

And so with the invention of the sewing machine came other tools to help make sewing less cumbersome. These handy tools were created with sewists in mind, to address well known problems and some you may not even have encountered yet!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"1needlethreader\">1. Needle Threader</h4>\n\n<p>Even the most experienced sewists fumble with threading a needle from time to time, which is why there is a multitude of threading tools meant to make this an easy process. Desk <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-580/clover-ultimate-needle-threader\" target=\"_blank\">needle threaders</a> tend to be the most effective as you simply drop your needle in (any size except tiny quilt petites), rest your thread in the slot and press the button. The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-580/clover-ultimate-needle-threader\" target=\"_blank\">Clover Ultimate Needle Threader</a> is our favorite and, quite honestly, a must-have for anyone looking to simplify the needle threading process.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-580_needle_threader.jpg\" alt=\"5 Handy Sewing Accessories\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2frixionpens\">2. Frixion Pens</h4>\n\n<p>These clever pens have a huge following and, if you’ve ever used one, you’ll understand why. They can draw on both fabric and paper patterns and they utilize a gel that erases with heat. Simply draw out what you need and then iron away the evidence! If you’re going to go this route, we suggest the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0375099/pilot-frixion-ball-erasable-gel-pens-8pkg-assorted-colors\" target=\"_blank\">Pilot FriXion Ball Erasable Gel Pens</a> as they’re easy to use and get the job done.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/0375099_gel_pens.jpg\" alt=\"5 Handy Sewing Accessories\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3patternweights\">3. Pattern Weights</h4>\n\n<p>Ever try to cut a pattern from a delicate fabric only to realize that the pins snagged the fabric? Us too! Pattern weights are great as they allow you to cut patterns without the pins. We highly recommend these <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-2204/dritz-4-pattern-weights\" target=\"_blank\">Dritz Pattern Weights</a> if you use patterns often.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-2204_pattern_weights.jpg\" alt=\"5 Handy Sewing Accessories\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4acrylicruler\">4. Acrylic Ruler</h4>\n\n<p>Straight and accurate cuts are crucial parts of any project, but they can also be hard to achieve. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rulers\" target=\"_blank\">Acrylic rulers</a> make this easy, especially when used with a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?product-type=rotary-blades\" target=\"_blank\">rotary cutter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?product-type=mats\" target=\"_blank\">cutting mat</a>. Our personal favorite ruler is the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-451/olipfa-ruler-with-lip-edge-5x24\" target=\"_blank\">O’lipfa Ruler with Lip Edge</a> as its size (5” x 24”) makes long cuts possible and it features a unique lip edge that keeps the ruler straight on the edge of the mat.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_NR-451_olipfa_ruler.jpg\" alt=\"5 Handy Sewing Accessories\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"5seamripper\">5. Seam ripper</h4>\n\n<p>Ripping seams can be quite frustrating and time consuming, which is why a good seam ripper made our list of must-haves. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0488106/tula-pink-55-surgical-seam-ripper\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink's Surgical Seam Ripper</a> is a popular choice amongst sewists as it features a sharp blade instead of the normal tip and is a quick way to rip out stitches.</p>\n\n<p>This seam ripper is part of the overall <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tula-pink-limited-edition-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink Limited Edition Tools</a> line, which also includes shears, micro-tip scissors, and a number of other tools designed to provide utility and style. The gorgeous coloring on these stainless steel <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tula-pink-limited-edition-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Tula Pink</a> products provides second to none style for your sewing room.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/5%20Handy%20Sewing%20Accessories/Large_0488106_tula_pink_seam_ripper.jpg\" alt=\"5 Handy Sewing Accessories\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>If you thought that all you needed to accomplish your goal was your sewing machine, then you have been missing out! Having the right sewing accessories can reduce headaches and encourage you to pick up those projects you have been putting off. Plus, these products make wonderful gifts for someone new to the craft, making it easy to pass your love for sewing on to someone else! </p>",

They just don’t make furniture like they used to. Vintage pieces have the best lines, they were made so sturdy, and you can always tell a difference in the filling. There’s nothing like leaning back onto an old beautiful vintage sofa. You can FEEL the difference. Sure you can find replicas, but they just aren’t the same. \n\nI’m always looking for vintage pieces for different clients. But trust me when I say this. 99.9% will always need a recover. No matter how much cleaning you do. Some stains just won’t come out. And usually the color doesn’t go with the design plan. So an upholsterer is almost always necessary. \n\nTake for example this vintage piece I recently had recovered:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/DSC_0321-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/DSC_0310-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nIsn’t it stunning? I mean, this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/bf-213/alpine-upholstery-velvet-hunter-green\" target=\"_blank\">green velvet</a> is EVERYTHING. But it didn’t always look this way. Here’s what it looked like when I found it: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/before.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nA French Provencial antique sourced from a local shop that had closed? I was in love! It had such great bones. It just really needed a recover. \n\nNow it was time to find the perfect <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. I knew that I was on a budget, and that I needed <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> that would be durable and sturdy enough to put up with my two dogs.  I’m one of those dog moms who doesn’t mind letting the pups on the couch. So durability was so important. (Dogs are people too!) \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/DSC_0298-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSo I was the world’s happiest girl when I came across this gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/bf-213/alpine-upholstery-velvet-hunter-green\" target=\"_blank\">green velvet</a> from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>. Their site is great because it lists all the projects that the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> would be suitable for, as well as a price point. (Plus they offer swatches so you can be 100% sure that what you are ordering is exactly what you wanted- and that it’s the durability you’d hoped for!)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/fabrics.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLuckily I’ve had enough pieces redone in the past, and I’ve made mistakes. A lot of them. So hopefully sharing these tips with you will help you save money (and time) by learning from mine!\n\nThere are several things I look for when I’m looking for a good upholsterer. \n\n\n####1) Do they “get” my vision? \nThere’s nothing worse than dropping off a piece for a recover and picking it up and it looking NOTHING like what you expected. Not only has your time been wasted, but so has theirs. (Not to mention the cost of redoing it to get it how you want it.) So bring photos and sketches. Sometimes I even pop in mid job for a “direction check” to make sure we are on the same page. \n\n####2)\tDo they know what they are doing? \nWhen I was just getting started as a decorator, I didn’t do my research. I hired the first person I could find online who labeled themselves as an upholstery expert. Boy, oh boy, was I wrong. Not only was the job done improperly, but the fabric I’d purchased was wrong. \n\nEven though the “expert” I’d hired told me it would be fine, it ended up being way too stretchy and after a month or so the shape was completely off. All this to say, hiring online is totally fine. Just research them first. Get references. Is this the first piece they have done like this? How long does a job usually take? How much time can they devote? Or is it something they just do on the side? (Also, totally okay, but always a question I ask up front so that I can manage my own expectations). \n\n####3)\tDo they deliver? \nThis is an important one for me simply because I don’t always have a crew member available to help with the heavy lifting. Plus, my personal car isn’t big enough, so delivery is always so nice. It saves so much hassle. Sometimes there is a fee, but it usually isn’t much. Totally worth it not having to worry about how you’ll get it home!\n\n####4)\tDo they have the time?\nI’ve worked with upholsterers in the past who said they could “fit” my job in. If you have a hard deadline, let them know up front first. If you plan on having friends over for a big reveal, or are having a party or whatever the case may be and need to piece there- make sure they know. \n\n####5)\tDo they know their fabric? \nAnd are they going to be honest about it? In my early days of decorating for a living, I was working with a client on a super tight budget. We purchased <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> from a discount place that was labeled “upholstery” fabric. When I brought the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> to the upholstery place, they said it would be fine and I believed them. Except it wasn’t fine. The fabric was stretchy, and because it was stretchy, the piece didn’t end up looking like it was supposed to. \n\nA good upholsterer, because they get your vision, will say, “Hey. No. This won’t work.” And to me that’s invaluable. It will save you time and money in the long run. The piece will last longer, and you’ll be happier. Just like I am with my gorgeous new sofa. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Choosing an Upholsterer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Choosing%20an%20Upholsterer/DSC_0125-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI’d love to hear about your adventures in upholstery!

It's Bev from <a href=\"http://flamingotoes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flamingo Toes</a> here today with a fun FREE quilt pattern for you! This Fun Flamingo Quilt with free pattern is a great project to show off your flamingo style and it's just in time for Summer! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20with%20Free%20Pattern.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIt's a big throw quilt made up of pixelated squares so it's super easy to sew! No special angles of complicated piecing here. Just rows of bright summer fabrics that make up this cute tropical flamingo!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Fabulous%20Flamingo%20Quilt.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI'm so in love with the aqua colors in that background - it reminds me of beaches and hot summer days. This is a great beginner quilt too! It's made up of simple squares so if you can sew a straight line - you can sew this!\n\nSo let's dive in!\n\n####Materials (for Finished Quilt Size - 63\" x 83\")\nYou can select any <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/quilting-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">quilting fabric</a> on fabric.com for this quilt. The colors below are just suggestions! You'll want a pretty light color for your background, then you’ll choose two highlighting fabrics that are a little different. Play with colors by saving swatches to the fabric.com Design Wall - this will let you look at them all in one easy spot!\n\n* Main Aqua Print in Background - 3 1/2 yards\n* Highlight Blue Print in Background - 1/2 yard\n* Highlight Green in Background - 1/2 yard\n* Medium Pink for Flamingo Body - 1/2 yard\n* Dark Pink for Flamingo Wing - 1/4 yard\n* Light Pink for Flamingo Beak - 1/4 yard\n* Black for Beak and Legs - 1/4 yard\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0366390/urban-zoologie-flamingos\" target=\"_blank\">Flamingo Print for Backing</a> - 5 yards\n* Black and White Stripe for Binding - 1 yard\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/cbr-003/warm-natural-cotton-batting-twin-sized\" target=\"_blank\">Batting</a> \n\nClick <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/quilting-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to shop for quilting fabrics!\n\n####Pattern Download\n<a href=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to download the free Flamingo Quilt Pattern!</a> \n\nOr, if you would like to purchase a low cost, ad free PDF version of this pattern that is designed for easy printing, <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/flamingotoes\" target=\"_blank\">visit my Etsy shop.</a> Thanks!\n\n####Cutting & Sewing\nThis quilt looks complicated but it's really not - it's just a matter of sewing the squares together in blocks, then sewing the blocks together. It takes some time but it's totally worth it!\n\nPrint out the quilt layout before you get started. This will help you know where the different colors go and how to sew everything together. I also realllllly recommend having a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rotary-blades\" target=\"_blank\">rotary cutter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=mats\" target=\"_blank\">mat</a> for cutting out your squares. The process will go much quicker and be way more accurate over cutting them out by hand.\n\n#####Cut out of your fabrics the following 2 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" squares\n* Pale Pink for Beak - 5 squares\n* Med Pink for Flamingo Body - 108 squares\n* Dark Pink for Flamingo Wing - 22 squares\n* Black for beak and legs - 29 squares (cut another small 1\" square for eye)\n* Main Aqua Background - 854 squares\n* Highlight Blue - 101 squares\n* Highlight Green - 80 squares\n\nKeep workable stacks of your fabrics near your sewing machine so you can pull each color square as needed.\n\n####Assembly Instructions: (all seams are 1/4\" seam allowance)\nStart with the top left block square on the pattern. Chain stitch together the 1st and 2nd little blocks in the top five columns by stitching the blocks right sides together along the right edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Step%201-01.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut the blocks apart. Sew the column 3 blocks to the right side of the column 2 blocks.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Step%202-01-01.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat with columns four and five. Now you should have 5 rows of 5 squares each.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Step%203-01.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress the seams to one side on the back but alternate which side you press to for each row. For example, press the top row to the left, the second row to the right, and so on. This will help the seams nest together.\n\nSew row one to row two - right sides together and meeting seams. I found it easiest to pin the first and last seam, the middle two usually met up at that point. I also didn't freak out if they were a little off. There are so many seams in this - and some of them will be off. If you adjust to that going in, you won't worry so much when it happens. :) Continue sewing the rows together until you have a 5 x 5 block.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Step%204-01.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress all the row seams down towards the bottom of the block. Now you've finished Block 1!\n\nRepeat these steps for the next block section but press all the row seams up towards the top of the block. Continue on across the top row of the quilt until you have six 5 x 5 blocks. These are the blocks in the top row of the pattern.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Step%205-01.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew block one to block 3, right sides together and lining up seams. Continue sewing the blocks together until you have one long row. Press the seams you just sewed open. This is Row 1. Set this aside.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">PDF pattern</a> and repeat these steps down each row of the quilt. Because there are so many little squares, I found it easier to assemble each row as I completed the blocks. This keeps each block in the correct row and you can make sure you have the alignment and direction correct.\n\nBefore you start piecing the rows together, applique on the eye by placing it on the flamingo and zig zag stitching around the four sides. If you have fusible webbing you can hold it in place before stitching with that. Refer to the pattern for placement.\n\nOnce you have all eight rows finished, begin sewing the rows together. Sew row one to row two, lining up the block seams and pinning. Next, sew row 3 to row 2 and so on down the quilt. Press the long row seams open and give the quilt a final pressing.\n\nQuilt and bind as desired. Mine was quilted with an all over loopy pattern by <a href=\" https://www.facebook.com/Julies-Longarm-Quilting-Service-794549267317106/\" target=\"_blank\">Julie Williams</a>. She did a great job!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Sweet%20and%20Simple%20Flamingo%20Quilt.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI used a fun black and white stripe for the binding and this awesome all over flamingo print for the backing. They look so great together!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Flamingo%20Quilt%20Back.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow you can show off your fun new flamingo quilt! It would be a great gift for a flamingo loving friend too!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flamingo Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flamingo%20Quilt/Simple%20to%20Sew%20Flamingo%20Quilt.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n",

                        "markdown": "Created by: Shannon McBride\n\nMaxi dresses are so chic and easy, from day to night, they have become a staple wardrobe item for warm weather. \n\nOver the past 5 years, I’ve made a few, bought a few, and worn them frequently. From my experience, here are some tips on how to choose your fabric based on the knit maxi dress you want to create.\n\nLet's explore the pros and cons of different fabric types!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/221334830\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/221334830\">Choosing the Perfect Knit for Summer Maxi Dresses</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/fabricdotcom\">Fabric.com</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Summer Maxi Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Summer%20Maxi%20Dresses/Rayon%20Knit%20dress-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Rayon/Spandex Jersey Knit:\n#####Pros:\t\n* Breathable\n* Very soft and comfortable on the skin\n* Drapes well\n* Well priced\n\n#####Cons:\n* Pills\n* High maintenance wash care\n* Clingy\n* Warps\n* Fades\n\n*Dress made with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530626/rayon-spandex-jersey-knit-rose-cluster-black-rose-quartz\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon Spandex Jersey Knit Rose Cluster Black/Rose Quartz</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&fiber-content-range=rayon-or-rayon-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon and Rayon Spandex jersey knits</a> are extremely common fibers for knit maxi dresses. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&fiber-content-range=rayon-or-rayon-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon</a> is a hybrid synthetic/natural fiber derived from wood pulp. It is very soft, silky and has a slight sheen and has excellent drape. The drape of rayon, its breathability, and soft feel against the skin makes this fabric very attractive for maxi dresses. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&fiber-content-range=rayon-or-rayon-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon</a> typically has low abrasion resistance and low color-fastness, so over time it will pill. \n\nBecause of its wood pulp origin, there is some wrinkling – but not bad. Rayon can be thin and clingy when stretched, so it is best for a flowy maxi dress, not form-fitting dresses. \nThe pilling and color fade will increase dramatically the more the fabric goes through a dryer cycle, therefore it is always best for rayon garments to lay flat/hang to dry. Because of the drape of rayon, it is best to lay flat to dry instead of hang dry, as the weight can warp the shape of the garment while it dries. But that’s a lot of fabric to lay out to dry! Indeed, it is. If you can’t commit to wet fabric taking up that amount of floor space, you could hang the dress halfway over a pants hanger, so that the weight is evenly distributed. Whether you let the rayon maxi dress lay flat to dry or use the half hang method to dry, throw it in the dryer on a low heat setting for 5 minutes to fluff and take the wrinkles out. \n\nDry cleaning is best, but that can get expensive. The first maxi dress I ever made was rayon. It lasted 2 summers because despite my knowledge of rayon, I dried it in the dryer anyway for convenience– and after 2 summers, it was warped, faded, very pilled and unwearable. Rayon maxi dresses are comfortable and drape well against the body, but require a higher maintenance of care if you want to wear the garment season after season.\n\n####Bamboo Rayon/Spandex Jersey Knit:\n#####Pros:\n* Durability\n* Soft hand\n* Breathable\n* Slightly easier maintenance than regular rayon\n* Color fast\n\n#####Cons:\n* Can’t get wet while worn\n* More expensive\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&fiber-content-range=bamboo-or-bamboo-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Bamboo Rayon Spandex jersey knit</a> is a more durable Rayon fabric – it is more color fast and abrasion resistant than regular rayon. It is a thicker jersey knit too, making it ideal for form fitting maxi dresses as opposed to flowy ones. \n\nBamboo Rayon does have a weakness – water. It is so bizarre to wear a bamboo rayon garment in the rain! The rain drops will make puckers in the fabric from where the water has temporarily weakened the fiber. It goes back to normal after it’s dried. So if you make a dress out of bamboo rayon, do not wear it if you know you’ll be sweating or in the rain.

It is very soft, silky and has a slight sheen and has excellent drape. The drape of rayon, its breathability, and soft feel against the skin makes this fabric very attractive for maxi dresses. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&amp;fiber-content-range=rayon-or-rayon-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon</a> typically has low abrasion resistance and low color-fastness, so over time it will pill. </p>\n\n<p>Because of its wood pulp origin, there is some wrinkling – but not bad. Rayon can be thin and clingy when stretched, so it is best for a flowy maxi dress, not form-fitting dresses. <br />\nThe pilling and color fade will increase dramatically the more the fabric goes through a dryer cycle, therefore it is always best for rayon garments to lay flat/hang to dry. Because of the drape of rayon, it is best to lay flat to dry instead of hang dry, as the weight can warp the shape of the garment while it dries. But that’s a lot of fabric to lay out to dry! Indeed, it is. If you can’t commit to wet fabric taking up that amount of floor space, you could hang the dress halfway over a pants hanger, so that the weight is evenly distributed. Whether you let the rayon maxi dress lay flat to dry or use the half hang method to dry, throw it in the dryer on a low heat setting for 5 minutes to fluff and take the wrinkles out. </p>\n\n<p>Dry cleaning is best, but that can get expensive. The first maxi dress I ever made was rayon. It lasted 2 summers because despite my knowledge of rayon, I dried it in the dryer anyway for convenience– and after 2 summers, it was warped, faded, very pilled and unwearable. Rayon maxi dresses are comfortable and drape well against the body, but require a higher maintenance of care if you want to wear the garment season after season.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bamboorayonspandexjerseyknit\">Bamboo Rayon/Spandex Jersey Knit:</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"pros\">Pros:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Durability</li>\n<li>Soft hand</li>\n<li>Breathable</li>\n<li>Slightly easier maintenance than regular rayon</li>\n<li>Color fast</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"cons\">Cons:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can’t get wet while worn</li>\n<li>More expensive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=jersey-knit&amp;fiber-content-range=bamboo-or-bamboo-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Bamboo Rayon Spandex jersey knit</a> is a more durable Rayon fabric – it is more color fast and abrasion resistant than regular rayon. It is a thicker jersey knit too, making it ideal for form fitting maxi dresses as opposed to flowy ones. </p>\n\n<p>Bamboo Rayon does have a weakness – water. It is so bizarre to wear a bamboo rayon garment in the rain! The rain drops will make puckers in the fabric from where the water has temporarily weakened the fiber. It goes back to normal after it’s dried. So if you make a dress out of bamboo rayon, do not wear it if you know you’ll be sweating or in the rain. For longevity’s sake, laying a bamboo rayon jersey knit garment flat to dry is best and recommended. However, bamboo rayon can withstand the occasional dryer cycle from time to time. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Summer%20Maxi%20Dresses/ITY%20knit%20dress%20full%202-min.jpg\" alt=\"Summer Maxi Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"polyesterspandexityjerseyknit\">Polyester/Spandex ITY Jersey Knit:</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"pros\">Pros:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Color Fast</li>\n<li>Wrinkle resistant</li>\n<li>Drapes well</li>\n<li>Cut edge does not roll/unravel, so you can leave them unfinished and it still looks great!</li>\n<li>Doesn’t pill</li>\n<li>Low Maintenance wash care</li>\n<li>Retains shape</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"cons\">Cons:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not Breathable</li>\n<li>Absorbs odor</li>\n<li>Clingy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Dress made with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0347271/stretch-jersey-ity-knit-black\" target=\"_blank\">Stretch ITY Jersey Knit Black</a></p>\n\n<p>Another extremely common fabric type for maxi dresses is Polyester/Spandex ITY Jersey Knit.

                        "markdown": "Created by: Nikki Johnson of fabric.com\n\nAs the days get longer and hotter, sewing lots of great new summer apparel is a must! Summer dresses, skirts, camis and blouses all seem to feature lightweight fabrics in cotton or rayon like lawn, or challis... But how do you choose the right textile for your garment? Today we have some helpful information on the differences, characteristics, and our favorite fabrics for your next summer project!\n\n####Lawn\nCotton lawn is a fine shirting fabric made of combed threads for a super smooth finish with a crisp hand. It is not as smooth as voile, and is lighter and less structured than poplin. Usually opaque, this lighter weight shirting can be used for button-downs, blouses, and all kinds of lined dresses and skirts. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric 101 Summer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/blogDrape_2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSewing Tips: Use a fine sewing machine needle. If your fabric puckers, try lowering your tension. The ideal seam finishing technique to use is a French seam. You can also use sharp pinking shears. To hem, use a rolled hem either by hand or machine. \n\n\n#####Our Fabric Picks for Lawn: \n1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0512869/liberty-of-london-contemporary-classic-tana-lawn-donna-leigh-green\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty of London Tana Lawn Donna Leigh</a>\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456738/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-lawn-flamingoes-ivory\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co.

It is usually made out of Rayon, and boasts a super smooth hand that is cool to the touch, with amazing fluid drape. It’s perfect for all the trendy flowing dresses that are popping up. Since it is a cellulosic fiber, it is breathable and perfect for those hot summer days. Depending on the color and the fabric, you might need a lining. It’s usually recommended, even if the fabric is opaque, due to the slippery and lightweight nature of it.\n\nSewing Tips for Challis: As a lightweight fabric, challis also benefits from a sharp and fine sewing machine needle and a French seam, though it can still stand up to serged edges. Rayon is a little tricky to launder, and is prone to shrinkage – even if you pre-wash. You should always pre-wash or treat the fabric as you would after it is made into a garment, but for rayon – skip the dryer. It’s better to lay it flat to dry or skip the washing machine all together and dry clean. You might be shocked at an unexpected miniskirt or dress if your rayon makes it into the dryer!\n\n#####Our Fabric Picks for Challis: \n1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uo-413/telio-viscose-rayon-challis-coral\" target=\"_blank\">Viscose Rayon Challis Coral</a>\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0466373/rayon-challis-dreamer-tropical-leaf-royal\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon Challis Dreamer</a>\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0447429/rayon-challis-pineapple-print-berry-orchid\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon Challis Pineapple</a>\n4) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456733/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-rayon-challis-birch-floral-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co.

It is very similar to batiste, with a super silky and smooth hand. It’s usually semi-sheer, so a lining is recommended. It’s also got a bit of a crisp hand, so it doesn’t drape quite as well as batiste tends to. Voile is usually made of cotton, but it can also be found in rayon, silk, and silk/cotton blends. Voile is also a lovely breathable fabric that is perfect for spring and summer dresses and blouses.\n\nSewing Tips for Voile: Use a fine and sharp needle. Finish seams with sharp pinking shears, rayon seam binding, French seams, or serging. Narrow hems or rolled hems are best. You can finish necklines and armholes with a bias facing for a low-profile finishing technique.\n\n\n#####Our Fabric Picks for Voile: \n1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450458/art-gallery-observer-voile-indigo-window-crystal\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Observer Voile</a>\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0492747/telio-rayon-voile-flamingos-on-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Rayon Voile Flamingos</a>\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0399836/art-gallery-skopelos-voile-nisi-flora-oceanon\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Skopelos Voile</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric 101 Summer Fabrics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/voile_fabrics.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Our Pattern Picks for Voile: \n<a href=\"https://shop.deer-and-doe.fr/en/sewing-patterns/17-aubepine-dress-pattern.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deer and Doe Aubepine Dress</a>; <a href=\"https://www.colettepatterns.com/catalog/sorbetto\" target=\"_blank\">Colette Sorbetto</a>; <a href=\"https://megannielsen.com/collections/all-products/products/cascade-skirt-sewing-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Megan Nielsen Cascade Skirt</a>\n\n####Batiste\nBatiste is traditionally found in solid colors, and is used in heirloom sewing. In white or cream, it’s perfect for a christening gown, or a smocked baby dress in any color. Our favorites are the prints that are suitable for apparel for children and adults. Batiste is similar to voile in that it has a super smooth and silky finish, but it is much finer. It is airy, very lightweight, and usually quite sheer. It is most commonly found in cotton, but also can be found in silk.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric 101 Summer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/blogDrape_3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSewing tips: Use a fine, sharp needle to avoid puckering. Due to the lightness of the fabric in weight, it’s best to use a French seam to avoid puckering, and a rolled hem for finishing. A French hem is low-profile and can be done by hand or machine for a super professional look.

Summer dresses, skirts, camis and blouses all seem to feature lightweight fabrics in cotton or rayon like lawn, or challis... But how do you choose the right textile for your garment? Today we have some helpful information on the differences, characteristics, and our favorite fabrics for your next summer project!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"lawn\">Lawn</h4>\n\n<p>Cotton lawn is a fine shirting fabric made of combed threads for a super smooth finish with a crisp hand. It is not as smooth as voile, and is lighter and less structured than poplin. Usually opaque, this lighter weight shirting can be used for button-downs, blouses, and all kinds of lined dresses and skirts. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/blogDrape_2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric 101 Summer\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sewing Tips: Use a fine sewing machine needle. If your fabric puckers, try lowering your tension. The ideal seam finishing technique to use is a French seam. You can also use sharp pinking shears. To hem, use a rolled hem either by hand or machine. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourfabricpicksforlawn\">Our Fabric Picks for Lawn:</h5>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0512869/liberty-of-london-contemporary-classic-tana-lawn-donna-leigh-green\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty of London Tana Lawn Donna Leigh</a> <br />\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456738/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-lawn-flamingoes-ivory\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co.

It is usually made out of Rayon, and boasts a super smooth hand that is cool to the touch, with amazing fluid drape. It’s perfect for all the trendy flowing dresses that are popping up. Since it is a cellulosic fiber, it is breathable and perfect for those hot summer days. Depending on the color and the fabric, you might need a lining. It’s usually recommended, even if the fabric is opaque, due to the slippery and lightweight nature of it.</p>\n\n<p>Sewing Tips for Challis: As a lightweight fabric, challis also benefits from a sharp and fine sewing machine needle and a French seam, though it can still stand up to serged edges. Rayon is a little tricky to launder, and is prone to shrinkage – even if you pre-wash. You should always pre-wash or treat the fabric as you would after it is made into a garment, but for rayon – skip the dryer. It’s better to lay it flat to dry or skip the washing machine all together and dry clean. You might be shocked at an unexpected miniskirt or dress if your rayon makes it into the dryer!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourfabricpicksforchallis\">Our Fabric Picks for Challis:</h5>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uo-413/telio-viscose-rayon-challis-coral\" target=\"_blank\">Viscose Rayon Challis Coral</a> <br />\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0466373/rayon-challis-dreamer-tropical-leaf-royal\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon Challis Dreamer</a> <br />\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0447429/rayon-challis-pineapple-print-berry-orchid\" target=\"_blank\">Rayon Challis Pineapple</a> <br />\n4) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456733/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-les-fleurs-rayon-challis-birch-floral-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co.

It is very similar to batiste, with a super silky and smooth hand. It’s usually semi-sheer, so a lining is recommended. It’s also got a bit of a crisp hand, so it doesn’t drape quite as well as batiste tends to. Voile is usually made of cotton, but it can also be found in rayon, silk, and silk/cotton blends. Voile is also a lovely breathable fabric that is perfect for spring and summer dresses and blouses.</p>\n\n<p>Sewing Tips for Voile: Use a fine and sharp needle. Finish seams with sharp pinking shears, rayon seam binding, French seams, or serging. Narrow hems or rolled hems are best. You can finish necklines and armholes with a bias facing for a low-profile finishing technique.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourfabricpicksforvoile\">Our Fabric Picks for Voile:</h5>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450458/art-gallery-observer-voile-indigo-window-crystal\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Observer Voile</a> <br />\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0492747/telio-rayon-voile-flamingos-on-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Rayon Voile Flamingos</a> <br />\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0399836/art-gallery-skopelos-voile-nisi-flora-oceanon\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Skopelos Voile</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/voile_fabrics.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric 101 Summer Fabrics\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourpatternpicksforvoile\">Our Pattern Picks for Voile:</h5>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.deer-and-doe.fr/en/sewing-patterns/17-aubepine-dress-pattern.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deer and Doe Aubepine Dress</a>; <a href=\"https://www.colettepatterns.com/catalog/sorbetto\" target=\"_blank\">Colette Sorbetto</a>; <a href=\"https://megannielsen.com/collections/all-products/products/cascade-skirt-sewing-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Megan Nielsen Cascade Skirt</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"batiste\">Batiste</h4>\n\n<p>Batiste is traditionally found in solid colors, and is used in heirloom sewing. In white or cream, it’s perfect for a christening gown, or a smocked baby dress in any color. Our favorites are the prints that are suitable for apparel for children and adults. Batiste is similar to voile in that it has a super smooth and silky finish, but it is much finer. It is airy, very lightweight, and usually quite sheer. It is most commonly found in cotton, but also can be found in silk.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/blogDrape_3-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric 101 Summer\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sewing tips: Use a fine, sharp needle to avoid puckering. Due to the lightness of the fabric in weight, it’s best to use a French seam to avoid puckering, and a rolled hem for finishing. A French hem is low-profile and can be done by hand or machine for a super professional look. As batiste is usually sheer, it’s a good idea to fully line any dress or top for opacity and a little bit of structure. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourfabricpicksforbatiste\">Our Fabric Picks for Batiste:</h5>\n\n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0529087/italian-designer-cotton-silk-batiste-floral-white-purple-pink\" target=\"_blank\">Italian Designer Cotton Silk Batiste Floral</a> <br />\n2) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0461828/cloud-9-organic-frolic-batiste-filoli-multi\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9 Organic Frolic Batiste Filoli</a> <br />\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0515458/cloud-9-organic-floret-batiste-evening-asters-black\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9 Organic Floret Batiste Evening Asters</a> <br />\n4) <a href=\"vhttps://www.fabric.com/buy/ul-879/organic-batiste-white\" target=\"_blank\">Organic Batiste White</a>  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%3A%20Lawn%2C%20Challis%2C%20Voile%20and%20Batiste/batiste_fabrics.jpg\" alt=\"Fabric 101 Summer Fabrics\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"ourpatternpicksforbatiste\">Our Pattern Picks for Batiste:</h5>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.deer-and-doe.fr/en/sewing-patterns/29-melilot-shirt-pattern.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deer and Doe Melilot Shirt</a>; <a href=\"http://shop.truebias.com/product/ogden-cami\" target=\"_blank\">True Bias Ogden Cami</a>; <a href=\"https://voguepatterns.mccall.com/v9242\" target=\"_blank\">Vogue 9242</a></p>\n\n<p>Happy summer sewing, everyone!</p>",

Of course, our favorite way to refresh our homes or decorate for entertaining is with fun fabrics, whether it’s with a newly reupholstered couch or accents such as pillows or table runners. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">Burlap</a> is a beautiful choice for décor accents as it can be transformed easily. This loosely woven fabric is made of jute and has become popular in recent years after being the go-to fabric for rustic weddings. Its texture is perfect for creating rustic touches and the fabric itself is fairly inexpensive, which makes it an affordable option for updating your space. We’ve created a list of our favorite ways to add this popular fabric into your home: \n\n#### 1.\tWedding Décor\nRustic weddings are all the rage, and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> is the best fabric to use to make your magical shabby-chic barn wedding a reality!

Burlap on a pillowcase? But these are not pillowcases for your bed. They are purely for decorative use, or even on outdoor furniture. The benefit here is that pillowcases are relatively simple to make, and we carry high-quality pillow forms that can easily be covered. To make sure your pillow form doesn’t show through, use a contrasting or matching closer-woven fabric behind the burlap. To decorate the pillowcase, you simply need some spray paint and a stencil. You can use spray paint over letters to create pillowcases with your initials, or could use a design such as a leaf or a holiday-themed designs. The spray paint will give your home some color, while the design allows you to perfectly personalize the pillowcase. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Burlap](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/7%20Ways%20to%20Use%20Burlap/iStock-668150966-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#### 3.\tBurlap table runner\nTable runners are perfect for adding some visual depth to a table. They are easy to make, and you can even add fringe to the ends. Table runners can be used to keep your table looking fun year-round, and can be specialized for different seasons, giving your home a unique look. Try using spray paint or fabric paint and letter stencils to add your name or a holiday greeting to a burlap table runner before your next family gathering.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Burlap](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/7%20Ways%20to%20Use%20Burlap/iStock-629113708-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####4.\tBurlap vase\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">Burlap</a> vases are among the most popular burlap crafts. You can find a number of ways to use burlap with vases online on craft-making sites. One popular choice is to make a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> “sack” which will cover a mason jar. That way, the sack can be used over and over as you switch mason jars out for cleaning. You can also use hot glue and burlap trim on any jar or vase. Fill them with flowers to make a lovely table centerpiece. You can also use burlap-covered vases as simple rustic wedding table decor. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Burlap](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/7%20Ways%20to%20Use%20Burlap/iStock-599762582-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####5.\tBurlap Pin Board\nMaking a wall hanging with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> is another easy project. You can get a blank canvas from an art store and cover it with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> using glue or staples. The result is a “blank” template for creating most any project you would like. You can use it as a pin board for pictures and postcards, or you can use fabric paint to create a design that is unique to you. You could even stretch ribbons across and use clothespins to hang memorabilia. We’ve even seen contrasting fabric pockets for an all-in-one mail station!\n\n####6.\tBurlap Embroidery Hoop Art\nThis is one of the more creative options out there: using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> as a base for hoop art. The holes in burlap make it perfect for sewing-based projects such as this. Simply put <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">burlap</a> into an embroidery hoop, then sew on appliques, such as felt shapes. This is a fun project to do with kids, as they can use yarn and oversized needles for the sewing. Try adding some buttons to your hoop art to give some added depth, and soft materials to add texture.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Burlap](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/7%20Ways%20to%20Use%20Burlap/iStock-668634808-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####7.\tBurlap photo frames\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=burlap\" target=\"_blank\">Burlap</a> looks beautiful when placed behind photos in frames.

Throw in some Lycra Spandex in the already large variety of knit fabrics and that can be very intimidating to sewers! \n\nBut fear not, here are some tips and 3 solid stitches to sew easily with knit fabric!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/all_fabrics_square.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Walking Foot:\nA <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KKBA860/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">walking foot</a>, also known as an Even Feed foot, will evenly feed the two layers of fabric through the machine at the same time. This prevents the fabric from being stretched out as it’s sewn, which is why it is ideal for very stretchy knit fabrics.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/walking%20foot-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nA walking foot prevents your machine from “eating” your fabric. Very lightweight knits, or very stretchy knits often will get pushed down into the machine when the needle punctures at the beginning of a seam when using a general purpose foot.\nKnit fabrics that do not have that much stretch are actually better sewn using just a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KKBA860/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">general purpose presser foot</a>, which usually comes standard with the purchase of a sewing machine. The walking foot could actually feed the top layer too much, causing seam puckers.\n####Seam allowances:\nWhen sewing with a regular sewing machine, I like to sew with a 3/8’’ seam allowance to ensure seam quality as it feeds through the machine, then trim down the excess. Knits will not unravel, so simply trimming them ¼’’ from the seam stitch will reduce bulk.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/seam%20allowance-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Serger:\nA serger is a special sewing machine that seams, trims, and finishes all in one. A 4-thread or 3-thread overlock stitch is very common for knit sewing. Sergers are ideal for knit garment sewing and give professional results. \n\n####Which needle to choose?\nThe right needle can make or break your knit project! If the right one is not chosen, you risk sewing frustration with skipped stitches, or damaged fabric from needle punctures. I advise to have a variety on hand. These <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Singer-Titanium-Universal-Machine-Assorted/dp/B004YIEQMM/ref=sr_1_1?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1498536700&sr=1-1&keywords=sewing+machine+needle+color+knits\" target=\"_blank\">color coded needles</a> are my favorite!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-309/schmetz-ball-point-machine-needle-assortment\" target=\"_blank\">Ball Point Needles</a> :These are best, as opposed to a sharp needle, stretch needle or universal needle. The tip of the needle is smooth and rounded, so it can glide through the knit fibers, instead of piercing any fibers like a sharp (regular) needle could. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-304/schmetz-stretch-machine-needles-11-75\" target=\"_blank\">Stretch Needles</a>: Stretch needles have a slightly less rounded tip than Ball Point needles do. However they do have a longer scarf, so they can go slightly deeper to catch the bobbin thread. If you are getting skipped stitches on your knit project, try this needle. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-290/schmetz-universal-point-machine-needle-assortment\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Needles</a>: Universal needles have the same scarf length as ball point needles and a slightly less rounded tip than Ball Point needles do so that they can pierce woven fabrics also. These will work fine on knits, however, ball point needles are best for knits with Lycra Spandex, or knits with very fine fibers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/table2.PNG)\n</p>\n \nMachine needles perform best when new. After about 8 hours of sewing time, they should be replaced. They could dull or bend, cause skipped stitches, or risk a broken needle puncturing your fabric.\n####Machine Settings:\nWhat machine settings to use are a big culprit of knit sewing anxiety. With the vast varieties of knits available, there’s no one perfect setting to configure. The best advice is to test on scrap fabric before sewing your project. This will save so much time not having to undo stitches, save your fabric, and ultimately, save your project! \n#####Tension: \nFor loftier knits or stable knits, like ponte or scuba knit fabrics, try a lower tension around 2 or 3. Around 4 is usually good for heavyweight knits. The 4-5 Tension range generally yields the best results with light to medium weight knits. If you have to use a tension above 6, your machine probably needs servicing.\n#####Stitch Length: \nLonger stitch lengths cause less warp on knit fabrics. Even though straight stitches should not be used for seams, straight stitches set to 4 stitch length can work for topstitching. Shorter stitch lengths (1.5 – 2) should be used with a zig zag stitch to ensure that fabric doesn’t pucker out of the zig zag when the seam is pulled.\n#####Stitch Width: \nApplicable to zig zag stitches, 4-5 creates a deeper, wider zig zag, and around 1-2 creates a narrow zig zag stitch. \nEvery machine is different depending on its condition, so again, always test first!\n#####Stitch Settings:\nA regular straight stitch will usually not work well for sewing seams with knits, especially Lycra Spandex knits. There are ways to manipulate the fabric as you sew, but it is not ideal and will not yield the best results. It may sew nicely, however, but when put to the test, the seam will easily pop and break once stretched:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/knit%20popped%20seam-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Zig Zag stitch:\nA simple zig zag stitch will allow the seam to stretch without popping:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/zig%20zag%20grey-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nZig zag stitch across the grain with standard presser foot (not recommended, it stretches the fabric):\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/replacement%20pic.jpg)\n</p>\n\nZig zag stitch, sewn across the grain with walking foot (recommended for stretchy fabrics):\n\n####Narrow Zig Zag Stitch:\nA narrow zig zag stitch can be achieved by setting both stitch length and width low, while on a zig zag setting. This stitch can closely mimic the look of a straight stitch, allow the seam to stretch with the fabric, increase sewing speed, and reduce bulk in the seams allowance. This stitch is not recommended for skin-tight garments like leotards or leggings because when the seam is pulled tight, it will have a ladder appearance.\n\nA narrow zig zag stitch with a general purpose foot: \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/shallow%20zig%20stripe-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAs you can see, the seam worked beautifully without the need of a walking foot since this fabric doesn’t have much stretch:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/shallow%20zig%20finish%20stripe%20matches-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNarrow zig zag stitch on stretchy fabric, used a walking foot:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/narrow%20zig%20zag%20stitch.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Stretch Straight Stitch:\nNot all sewing machines have a stretch stitch setting, especially older ones, but most machines made within the last 10 years have a stretch setting. A stretch straight stitch is a series of forward and backward stitches that allow the seam to stretch, but with the appearance of a regular straight stitch. \n\nA downside to using this stitch is it is almost impossible to take the seam out if you’ve made a mistake. Seam rippers, scissors and time might get it out, but the quality of the fabric will likely be damaged and warped. Another downside is that it takes longer to sew. Since the stitch itself is made up of several stitches, the speed of which it feeds through the machine is slower. This seam, however, gives great results when properly used!\n\nStretch Straight Stitch, with a general purpose presser foot:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/stretch%20stritch%20stripes-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nStretch Straight Stitch with a walking foot, because this grey rib knit fabric is super stretchy:\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips with Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/stretchstraihght.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis fabric is super stretchy with 75% stretch, and there is only very minimal ruffling from using a walking foot with a stretch straight stitch.

Throw in some Lycra Spandex in the already large variety of knit fabrics and that can be very intimidating to sewers! </p>\n\n<p>But fear not, here are some tips and 3 solid stitches to sew easily with knit fabric!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/all_fabrics_square.jpg\" alt=\"Tips with Knits\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"walkingfoot\">Walking Foot:</h4>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KKBA860/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">walking foot</a>, also known as an Even Feed foot, will evenly feed the two layers of fabric through the machine at the same time. This prevents the fabric from being stretched out as it’s sewn, which is why it is ideal for very stretchy knit fabrics.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/walking%20foot-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips with Knits\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>A walking foot prevents your machine from “eating” your fabric. Very lightweight knits, or very stretchy knits often will get pushed down into the machine when the needle punctures at the beginning of a seam when using a general purpose foot. <br />\nKnit fabrics that do not have that much stretch are actually better sewn using just a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KKBA860/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">general purpose presser foot</a>, which usually comes standard with the purchase of a sewing machine. The walking foot could actually feed the top layer too much, causing seam puckers.  </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"seamallowances\">Seam allowances:</h4>\n\n<p>When sewing with a regular sewing machine, I like to sew with a 3/8’’ seam allowance to ensure seam quality as it feeds through the machine, then trim down the excess. Knits will not unravel, so simply trimming them ¼’’ from the seam stitch will reduce bulk.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20with%20Knits/seam%20allowance-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips with Knits\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"serger\">Serger:</h4>\n\n<p>A serger is a special sewing machine that seams, trims, and finishes all in one. A 4-thread or 3-thread overlock stitch is very common for knit sewing. Sergers are ideal for knit garment sewing and give professional results. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whichneedletochoose\">Which needle to choose?</h4>\n\n<p>The right needle can make or break your knit project!

The zig-zagging pattern is easy to piece, making it a wise choice even for beginners. And the design lends itself well to any number of color combinations, with each one looking different from the next. The simple style is perfect for everything from baby blankets to quilted comforters. Plus, chevron quilts make great gifts, even when you don’t know much about the recipient’s style.

Well-known popularity surges include Missoni taking chevron to the high-end clothing market beginning in the 1950s, and then refusing to give up any ground in the fashion world, as Missoni remains popular to this day. The chevron makes for simple coordination with other pieces, and is easy on the eyes. The same pattern that your grandmother used in her quilts now looks great on everything from clothes to walls to furniture.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">chevron</a> quilt has always been, and will continue to be, one of the most popular choices for quilters, sewists and DIY fans of all ages. As you consider your next project, take a look at the gorgeous options available on our chevron page. \n\nFor simple styles, you can choose a single-colored pattern on a white background, such as <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0327422/chevron-grey\" target=\"_blank\">this grey chevron option</a>. Or, for something a bit brighter, this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0268159/riley-blake-medium-chevron-flannel-rainbow\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Rainbow Flannel</a> is a fun choice. You can choose from thin or wide designs, with varying “zigs and zags” to make each of your creations one of a kind. All of our chevron fabrics are 100% cotton or cotton blends, making them breathable and soft - two features that are well-suited for blankets and other frequently-used home items. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chevron](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Trends%3AChevron/Untitled%20Catalog10188-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a>'s strength as a quilting and home decorator fabric isn’t going anywhere. If you are looking to buy fabric online, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">chevron</a> is a great choice as the design is familiar, letting you focus on color and stripe patterns to find the print that is right for you.

The same pattern that your grandmother used in her quilts now looks great on everything from clothes to walls to furniture.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">chevron</a> quilt has always been, and will continue to be, one of the most popular choices for quilters, sewists and DIY fans of all ages. As you consider your next project, take a look at the gorgeous options available on our chevron page. </p>\n\n<p>For simple styles, you can choose a single-colored pattern on a white background, such as <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0327422/chevron-grey\" target=\"_blank\">this grey chevron option</a>. Or, for something a bit brighter, this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0268159/riley-blake-medium-chevron-flannel-rainbow\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Rainbow Flannel</a> is a fun choice. You can choose from thin or wide designs, with varying “zigs and zags” to make each of your creations one of a kind. All of our chevron fabrics are 100% cotton or cotton blends, making them breathable and soft - two features that are well-suited for blankets and other frequently-used home items. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Trends%3AChevron/Untitled%20Catalog10188-min.jpg\" alt=\"Chevron\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a>'s strength as a quilting and home decorator fabric isn’t going anywhere. If you are looking to buy fabric online, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=chevron\" target=\"_blank\">chevron</a> is a great choice as the design is familiar, letting you focus on color and stripe patterns to find the print that is right for you.

Beauty\nWhen you are creating a handmade item using fabric, you want it to be more than just soft. For example, making your project pleasing to the eye can be as important as its feel. Your home decor pieces are almost always going to be seen before they are touched - therefore, beauty is an important attribute for any home decor fabric. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> is also a perfect choice when you wish to add style to your space. In addition to its softness, chenille is also known for its beauty. \n\nOne of the reasons why <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> is so attractive is the way that the chenille material can contrast with the background fabric. This contrast can create beautiful patterning, such as in our <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0514886/monterey-gate-chenille-jacquard-graphite\" target=\"_blank\">Monterey Gate Chenille</a>, or combinations of both color and texture contrasts, such as this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0504975/fabricut-tsunami-chenille-mango\" target=\"_blank\">Fabricut Tsunami Chenille</a>. Many <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> options also feature an incredible luster, making them extremely pleasing to the eye, and a wonderful choice for your next home style upgrade.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chenille](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Large_0514886.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chenille](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Large_0504975.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####3. Versatility\nWhen you choose a fabric for its softness and beauty, sometimes you are limiting yourself to the types of applications that are suitable for your choice. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a>, fortunately, does not limit you in this way. It comes in a variety of weights, making it a perfect choice for lighter weight projects or even heavy upholstery projects, due to its incredible versatility. You can use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> for everything from valances to throw pillows, bedspreads or upholstery projects - depending upon your chosen fabric weight. Our  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx?collection=10-ounce-chenille\" target=\"_blank\">10 ounce cotton chenille</a> options, for example, are available in a number of colors and are well-suited for soft, fluffy robes and pillows. Or, consider some of our heavier weight options for slipcovers or heavy drapes. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chenille](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Untitled%20Catalog10201.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a>’s versatility makes it a great go-to for a variety of projects, which is why we suggest keeping it in the back of your mind when selecting fabric for your next project.

This contrast can create beautiful patterning, such as in our <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0514886/monterey-gate-chenille-jacquard-graphite\" target=\"_blank\">Monterey Gate Chenille</a>, or combinations of both color and texture contrasts, such as this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0504975/fabricut-tsunami-chenille-mango\" target=\"_blank\">Fabricut Tsunami Chenille</a>. Many <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> options also feature an incredible luster, making them extremely pleasing to the eye, and a wonderful choice for your next home style upgrade.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Large_0514886.jpg\" alt=\"Chenille\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Large_0504975.jpg\" alt=\"Chenille\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3versatility\">3. Versatility</h4>\n\n<p>When you choose a fabric for its softness and beauty, sometimes you are limiting yourself to the types of applications that are suitable for your choice. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a>, fortunately, does not limit you in this way. It comes in a variety of weights, making it a perfect choice for lighter weight projects or even heavy upholstery projects, due to its incredible versatility. You can use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a> for everything from valances to throw pillows, bedspreads or upholstery projects - depending upon your chosen fabric weight. Our  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx?collection=10-ounce-chenille\" target=\"_blank\">10 ounce cotton chenille</a> options, for example, are available in a number of colors and are well-suited for soft, fluffy robes and pillows. Or, consider some of our heavier weight options for slipcovers or heavy drapes. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chenille%20ActBold/Untitled%20Catalog10201.jpg\" alt=\"Chenille\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric-chenille-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a>’s versatility makes it a great go-to for a variety of projects, which is why we suggest keeping it in the back of your mind when selecting fabric for your next project. It’s super soft and beautiful and great for transforming your home into the space of your dreams! </p>",

It's Jessica from <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a>. I'm so thankful to be back on the fabric.com blog! Today I'm talking about picking fabric that works well with your home style. Sewing new curtains or throw pillows for a room can completely change the space or work to drive home the look you're wanting.  I know that for some people, choosing fabric from pages and pages of options on a website or rows and rows of choices in a store can be overwhelming. And even if that part isn't overwhelming, you might just need to put a name and a few visuals to help you define the look you're wanting. If any of this is you, hopefully I can help out today and start you down the path of finishing out a space with the perfect pick in fabric. \n\nNow, I'm all about the eclectic look. My advice is 'if you like it, use it'. I love mixing and matching fabrics and patterns between styles. I know, though, that some people like to stick with a specific feel for their space. \n\nSo here we go. Below, you'll read about five different styles that I feel are trending and what fabrics I would use to achieve each look!\n\n####Vintage\nFirst up, I'll start with the vintage look. I think these can best be identified as a retro feel with graphic patterns. To me, they feel casual and fun. I think the best way to get an updated vintage look in your home is to use more neutral, modern  colors like the ones below.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%201-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332907/robert-allen-home-handcut-shapes-charcoal\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477148/genevieve-gorder-urban-caterpillar-resin-glow\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0491297/lacefield-echo-granite-danish-linen?cm_mmc=pinterest-_-social-_-product-_-0491297\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0515452/cloud-9-organic-holding-pattern-barkcloth-get-lost-olive\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uq-053/premier-prints-aruba-felix-blue-natural\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0527724/lacefield-tulum-linen-blend-basketweave-ink-cambric\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n\nI used the first fabric in our bedroom when I first did a post for fabric.com about pattern mixing. You can find that post <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/tips-for-mixing-matching-fabric-in-your-home/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Again, my taste is totally eclectic. You don't have to stick to one particular style.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTo complete the vintage look, pair any of these fabrics with brass, hairpin legged tables, mid century mod furniture, plants and wood tones.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nfabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0527724/lacefield-tulum-linen-blend-basketweave-ink-cambric\" target=\"_blank\">lacefield tulum linen blend basketweave</a>\n\n\n####Chic\nThe next style board I created is chic and these fabrics make me so happy. They say 'look at me' whether it's because of the prints, the colors, the scale or all three. These are bold and clean and glam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%204-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0517291/p-kaufmann-jungle-cat-basketweave-petal\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477119/genevieve-gorder-puff-dotty-onyx\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0479843/covington-venus-basketweave-caribbean\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0289069/premier-prints-indoor-outdoor-towers-grey\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0478963/robert-allen-home-aptura-floral-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477075/genevieve-gorder-flock-velvet-onyx\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n\nIf chic is what you're going for, these fabrics can be paired with colorful or neutral walls. Clean, modern lines, bright whites and lots of textures.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%205-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nfabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0479843/covington-venus-basketweave-caribbean\" target=\"_blank\">covington venus basketweave caribbean</a>\n\n####Farmhouse\nI did my fair share of searching for farmhouse fabrics when I was helping with the decorating of my parents house out in the country. The farmhouse look consists of neutrals in greys, taupe and whites on casual woven or linen looking fabric. Lots of traditional pattern but in very muted, monochromatic colors.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%206-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0319366/magnolia-home-fashions-adele-slate\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0328224/44-ticking-stripe-grey\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432774/premier-prints-shannon-ecru\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0443025/magnolia-home-fashions-talbot-mist\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408857/premier-prints-anderson-check-french-grey\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0395232/telio-tuscany-pinstripe-chambray-linen-light-tan-cream\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n\nI didn't pick this for my design board but in my parents house we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0284399/richloom-birdwatcher-charcoal\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> fabric as curtains on an entire wall in their living room. Since this print was a little more bold, I chose some fabrics like the ones above for pillows and upholstery. You can see more of their house <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/2016/08/farmhouse-tour-and-sources.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%207-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFor the farmhouse look, pair these fabrics with natural or white washed wood tones, burlap, clean lines, white paint and elements from nature like leaves, plants, or.....antlers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%208-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nfabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408857/premier-prints-anderson-check-french-grey\" target=\"_blank\">premier prints anderson check french grey</a>\n\n####Modern Traditional\nThe next grouping you might like is modern traditional. I think of this as a more updated take on classic prints. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%209-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0493565/kelly-ripa-home-good-vibes-fiesta\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0493562/kelly-ripa-home-floating-trellis-spa\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0514711/madcap-cottage-mill-reef-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477085/genevieve-gorder-intersections-steam\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0342082/magnolia-home-fashions-java-navy\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0515347/premier-prints-jing-regal\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n\nAny of these could work for curtains, as upholstery on dining chairs or as throw pillows in a traditional looking home style.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2010-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nfabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0514711/madcap-cottage-mill-reef-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">madcap cottage mill reef indigo</a>\n\n\nI picture these fabrics with polished metal finishes, bright white woods and clean, crisp wall colors.\n\n####Boho\nI saved my favorite for last. Boho is trending right now. To me, it's a mixture of tribal prints, a throwback to the 70's and a natural look. These fabrics are mostly neutral and very imperfect in such a relaxed, laid back way. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2011-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0393517/premier-prints-heni-slub-summerland-grey\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0489634/p-kaufmann-bantu-stone\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0491303/lacefield-medina-granite-basketweave\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458245/lacefield-tahitian-stitch-tusk\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432781/premier-prints-tribal-vintage-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0457278/premier-prints-carlo-vintage-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">6</a>\n\nYou may recognize the 4th fabric as I used it (in orange) to upholster a small wall in our hallway. It's such a cool print. You can see that project <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/fabric-wall-upholstery-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2012-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nAND I used the 6th print to recover our porch chairs in a patio makeover I talked about over on my blog, <a href=\"https://www.househomemade.us/2016/10/how-to-recover-chair-cushions.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2013-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhile we're talking about outdoor projects. I might have sprinkled some outdoor fabrics into this post. Don't discount them. Most are great for indoor use as well and with kids and/ or pets, why not have something way more durable?\n\nA boho style is all about warm wood tones, wicker, plants, and wall hangings. Pair these fabrics with a plush, textured rug, a vintage chair, fringe or tassels and lots of greenery.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![House Homemade Styles](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2014-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nfabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0491303/lacefield-medina-granite-basketweave\" target=\"_blank\">lacefield medina granite basketweave</a>\n\nI hope this post provided you with some ideas for recreating or adding extra style to a room in your home. I'd love for you to stop by <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a> any time and to visit me on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/househomemade/\" target=\"_blank\">@househomemade</a>. \n\nLet me know if I can answer any questions for you. I'd also love for you to comment and tell me which one is your favorite style board.\n\n\n",

Boho is trending right now. To me, it's a mixture of tribal prints, a throwback to the 70's and a natural look. These fabrics are mostly neutral and very imperfect in such a relaxed, laid back way. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2011-min.png\" alt=\"House Homemade Styles\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0393517/premier-prints-heni-slub-summerland-grey\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0489634/p-kaufmann-bantu-stone\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0491303/lacefield-medina-granite-basketweave\" target=\"_blank\">3</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0458245/lacefield-tahitian-stitch-tusk\" target=\"_blank\">4</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0432781/premier-prints-tribal-vintage-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">5</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0457278/premier-prints-carlo-vintage-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">6</a></p>\n\n<p>You may recognize the 4th fabric as I used it (in orange) to upholster a small wall in our hallway. It's such a cool print.

I might have sprinkled some outdoor fabrics into this post. Don't discount them. Most are great for indoor use as well and with kids and/ or pets, why not have something way more durable?</p>\n\n<p>A boho style is all about warm wood tones, wicker, plants, and wall hangings. Pair these fabrics with a plush, textured rug, a vintage chair, fringe or tassels and lots of greenery.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/House%20Homemade%20Fabric%20Styles/photo%2014-min.jpg\" alt=\"House Homemade Styles\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>fabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0491303/lacefield-medina-granite-basketweave\" target=\"_blank\">lacefield medina granite basketweave</a></p>\n\n<p>I hope this post provided you with some ideas for recreating or adding extra style to a room in your home.

When I realized my two hobbies of running and sewing could come together, I was so excited! \n\nI didn’t know where to start to make my own running gear. I researched all the patterns, drooled over fabrics I thought were appropriate, but felt stuck for over a year before I finally took the plunge. If you are feeling the same way, I’m here to tell you there is nothing to fear! \n\nWhen I first started sewing active wear, I was nervous. Would I be able to make pieces that would hold up just like my store bought items? But, just like sewing other wardrobe pieces, your handmade items usually last longer than store bought! With the right materials and tools, you can give your gym wear a new look and if anyone asks, “yeah, you made it yourself!” \n\n####Choosing Fabrics:\nThe number one fear I had about sewing activewear was what <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?searchText=activewear\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> to buy. Thankfully fabric.com makes it SO easy to find the right <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for your project. A quick search of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?searchText=activewear\" target=\"_blank\">\"activewear\"</a> will show a bunch of options for making leggings, sports bras, tops, and more!\n\nThere are a few qualities that make <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?searchText=activewear\" target=\"_blank\">active fabric</a> different from regular knits. \n\nThe first thing you want to look at is the content of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. Most active fabrics will contain polyester, nylon, spandex and/or lycra- contents that will give the material good stretch (and recovery) and should have the ability to wick away moisture.\n \nWhen buying <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>, keep an eye on the amount of stretch the material has (<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> has all this info in the description!). Each pattern will call for a different amount of stretch, and having your pattern ready to go will help when purchasing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0180-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Fabrics I chose and what to make with them: \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0391429/moisture-wicking-diamond-knit-black\" target=\"_blank\">Moisture Wicking Diamond Knit Black</a>: Great for leggings, would also be great for an after workout jacket. \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0517991/swimwear-activewear-spandex-knit-stripe-turquoise-multi\" target=\"_blank\">Swimwear/Activewear Spandex Knit Stripe Turquoise</a>: Great for Tops, Sports Bras, Leggings and Bike Shorts. \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450618/activewear-spandex-knit-solid-turquoise\" target=\"_blank\">Activewear Spandex Knit Solid Turquoise</a>: Great for leggings, tops and sports bras. \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/st-maarten-swimwear\" target=\"_blank\">St. Maarten Swimwear</a> Knit Stripes: Good for tops, shorts.  \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=athletic+mesh+knit\" target=\"_blank\">Athletic Mesh Knit</a>: Great for tops. \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450612/power-mesh-nude\" target=\"_blank\">Power Mesh Nude</a>: Want to add lining and cups to a sports bra? This will help. \n\nAlmost all of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com's</a>’s fabrics can be sent in swatch form so if you want to do a few fabric tests for yourself, buy a swatch! \n\n####Sewing your activewear: \n* Before using your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>, pre-wash! This will shrink any material and prevent dyed fabrics from bleeding when wearing. \n* Just like any sewing project, you need to use the proper <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=needles\" target=\"_blank\">needle</a>. With active fabrics, a ball point or stretch <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=needles\" target=\"_blank\">needle</a> is best. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0157-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTake your time! If you’ve sewn with knits, or even slippery material, you know that all <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> aren’t always a walk in the park to sew with. For extra strength, sew your straight seam and in the seam allowances, finish with a zig zag stitch or serge and trim the seam. \n\n####Make it professional: \nYou don’t need to sew with a coverstitch machine, serger or even a double needle, you can create beautiful professional pieces with the basics. Many machines have decorative stitches that you can use to create interesting seams. Test a few out on extra material!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0163-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0151-min.JPG)\n</p>\n \n####Store your fabrics: \nNot ready to sew with the materials you bought? Store them properly! Leave a note with the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> content so you can remember exactly what’s in it and can easily pair it with the right pattern. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0182-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![French Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0184-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####My favorite Patterns: \n* <a href=\"https://shop.fehrtrade.com/products/xyt-workout-top\" target=\"_blank\">XYT Top from Fehr Trade</a> \n* <a href=\"https://shop.fehrtrade.com/products/surf-to-summit-top-ladies\" target=\"_blank\">Surf to Summit Top from Fehr Trade</a>\n* <a href=\"https://jalie.com/jalie3462-cora-running-tights\" target=\"_blank\">Cora Tights from Jalie</a>\n* <a href=\"https://jalie.com/jalie3351-swim-shorts-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Swim Shorts from Jalie</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.simplicity.com/simplicity-pattern-8339-misses-knit-sports-bras/S8339.html#sz=30&start=66\" target=\"_blank\">Simplicity 8339</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.heyjunehandmade.com/product/sloan-leggings/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloan Leggings from Hey June Handmade</a>\n* <a href=\"https://papercutpatterns.com/collections/all/products/pneuma-tank\" target=\"_blank\">Pneuma Tank from Papercut Patterns</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.sewaholicpatterns.com/dunbar-top/\" target=\"_blank\">Dunbar Top from Sewaholic  </a>\n\n\n####My Workout Outfit: \nUsing Moisture Wicking Diamond Knit Black, Swimwear/Activewear Spandex Knit Stripe Turquoise, and Activewear Spandex Knit Solid Turquoise, I made a pair of <a href=\"https://www.heyjunehandmade.com/product/sloan-leggings/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloan Leggings</a> and <a href=\"http://www.simplicity.com/simplicity-pattern-8339-misses-knit-sports-bras/S8339.html#sz=30&start=66\" target=\"_blank\">Simplicity 8339</a>.

Each pattern will call for a different amount of stretch, and having your pattern ready to go will help when purchasing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0180-min.JPG\" alt=\"French Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"fabricsichoseandwhattomakewiththem\">Fabrics I chose and what to make with them:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0391429/moisture-wicking-diamond-knit-black\" target=\"_blank\">Moisture Wicking Diamond Knit Black</a>: Great for leggings, would also be great for an after workout jacket. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0517991/swimwear-activewear-spandex-knit-stripe-turquoise-multi\" target=\"_blank\">Swimwear/Activewear Spandex Knit Stripe Turquoise</a>: Great for Tops, Sports Bras, Leggings and Bike Shorts. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450618/activewear-spandex-knit-solid-turquoise\" target=\"_blank\">Activewear Spandex Knit Solid Turquoise</a>: Great for leggings, tops and sports bras. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/st-maarten-swimwear\" target=\"_blank\">St. Maarten Swimwear</a> Knit Stripes: Good for tops, shorts.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=athletic+mesh+knit\" target=\"_blank\">Athletic Mesh Knit</a>: Great for tops. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450612/power-mesh-nude\" target=\"_blank\">Power Mesh Nude</a>: Want to add lining and cups to a sports bra?

This will shrink any material and prevent dyed fabrics from bleeding when wearing. </li>\n<li>Just like any sewing project, you need to use the proper <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=needles\" target=\"_blank\">needle</a>. With active fabrics, a ball point or stretch <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=needles\" target=\"_blank\">needle</a> is best. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0157-min.JPG\" alt=\"French Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Take your time! If you’ve sewn with knits, or even slippery material, you know that all <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> aren’t always a walk in the park to sew with. For extra strength, sew your straight seam and in the seam allowances, finish with a zig zag stitch or serge and trim the seam. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"makeitprofessional\">Make it professional:</h4>\n\n<p>You don’t need to sew with a coverstitch machine, serger or even a double needle, you can create beautiful professional pieces with the basics. Many machines have decorative stitches that you can use to create interesting seams. Test a few out on extra material!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0163-min.JPG\" alt=\"French Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20With%20Activewear%20Fabric/DSC_0151-min.JPG\" alt=\"French Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"storeyourfabrics\">Store your fabrics:</h4>\n\n<p>Not ready to sew with the materials you bought?

This might require a screw driver. \t\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/take%20apart%20chair-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUse tools to remove staples/nails to remove the fabric and foam. My chair only had staples, and I was able to get them out by wedging a flat head screw driver and plyers. If nails are present, use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Great-Neck-TL4C-Tack-Lifter/dp/B00004Z2MI/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1500516326&sr=8-11&ppw=fresh\" target=\"_blank\">this tool</a> to get them out. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/staples%20removed-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Step 2: Foam cushion and batting\nPlace the seat on the 2” foam slab and trace with a marker.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/marker%20on%20foam-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nCut the foam using either an incredibly sharp serrated knife (think Infomercial knife demonstrations) or an insulation knife. We used an incredibly sharp serrated kitchen knife!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/cut%20foam-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nTake the seat + foam and place on the polyester batting. Trace about 5” outside the edge and cut. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/cut%20batting-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nUse the staple gun to secure the batting underneath, pulling tight as you go. Tip: It’s best to staple opposite sides until you’re about twelve staples in – that way the tightness will be even.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/staple%20batting-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nTrim excess.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/trim%20batting-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n \n####Step 3: Positioning and applying the fabric\nPosition the seat so that the motif print is centered, balanced, and allows for at least 4” to secure underneath. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/fabric%20position-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n \nThe print for this fabric is still visible on the wrong side, so I can see where to mark and cut to get the portion of the fabric I want for the seat cushion.

Trace the seat cushion on the dust cover fabric, cut. Fold ½ under and staple. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Chair Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chair%20Upholstery/dust%20cloth-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nReattach to the chair if necessary \n \nVoila!

I’m back with another great sewing tutorial for you.  \n\nAt a recent family reunion, my sister-in-law was wearing a t-shirt with really gorgeous sleeves that were knife pleated from the top to the middle of the sleeve, resulting in a bell/ruffle effect at the bottom of the sleeve. I loved these sleeves so much that I immediately decided I needed to recreate them for myself. It’s a really interesting design detail that adds a little flair to any basic top, and it’s totally on trend. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/styled4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis tutorial works great for any woven top (t-shirt) pattern with short sleeves. I used the <a href=\"https://www.heyjunehandmade.com/product/key-largo-top/?affiliates=76\" target=\"_blank\">Key Largo Top by Hey June Patterns</a> for my top, but another great option would be the <a href=\"https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/scout-tee-pdf/\" target=\"_blank\">Scout Tee by Grainline Studio</a>. The original top is from J.Crew and is made out of a knit material, so this could work for a knit t-shirt pattern as well. For this version, I decided to use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0529033/french-designer-rayon-challis-aztec-collage-red-pink-blue\" target=\"_blank\">this really pretty rayon fabric</a> from Fabric.com’s <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/french-designer-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">French Designer collection</a>. It was perfect for this top. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/styled3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n####Materials: \n* Water soluble <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?searchText=marking+pen\" target=\"_blank\">making pen</a>\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric</a> required for your pattern plus 1 yard extra for the sleeves\n* Rectangular <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rulers\" target=\"_blank\">ruler</a> \n* pattern paper / <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-363/wax-free-tracing-paper\" target=\"_blank\">tracing paper</a>\n* matching <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=pins\" target=\"_blank\">Pins</a>\n\n\n####Creating Your Sleeve Pattern\nLet’s begin by creating our sleeve pattern. It looks like a lot more work than it really is, I promise!\n\n1) First of all, using the premade sleeve pattern from your shirt, trace another copy on extra tracing paper. Make sure to mark just the bottom corner of your hem to use as a reference to add length in the next step.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n2) Next we need to add 2” in length to the sleeve pattern for a more dramatic looking sleeve from the bottom hemline of the newly traced sleeve. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n3) Draw a line down the center of your sleeve. \n\n4) Now, measuring every ½” from the center line, draw another line. Do this until you have about 15-17 pleats. Mine has 17. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo5-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n5) Now on a blank piece of tracing paper, draw a straight horizontal line along the bottom edge of the paper. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo6-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n6) Taking your pattern piece with all of the pleats now marked on it, cut along the first line drawn on the right side of the sleeves. Tape it on the right side of the new horizontal line we just drew, lining up the hem of the sleeve to the line. Measure and mark a ½” line next to this piece. (Mine is marked in orange). Now draw another ½” line next to this orange line. \n\n7) Go back to your sleeve pattern and cut the next line off, and tape it next to the two line you just drew. Draw and mark another two ½” marks next to it as we did with the previous sleeves piece. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo7-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n8) Continue doing this until all of the sleeves pieces are cut and taped to the tracing paper along the horizontal line. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo8-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo9-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n9) Now, using pins, fold all of your knife pleats on the paper pattern, pinning each on into place. Make note of the direction you fold your pleats. It doesn’t matter which direction you choose, but make sure to fold the same way once you are working with your fabric, otherwise your sleeve pleats won’t make the right sleeve shape. You can tell when you fold your fabric that it’s correct if there’s no fabric sticking up in the fold, but that it all matches up smoothly. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo10-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo11-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n10) Cut out the top curve of your sleeve pattern using scissors, then unpin and unfold. \n\n###Sewing a pleated sleeve\nNow your pattern is all finished. Let’s sew it up!\n\n1) Cut out all of your shirt pattern pieces. (The Key Largo pattern requires cutting two of the front bodice, I decided to cut my shirt front along the fold of the fabric, and made sure to cut off the front shirt bodice seam allowances before cutting. You can cut it however you like, fold or no fold. \n\n2) Cut out two sleeves. (I had to fold my fabric “hamburger style” to be able to fit the width of my new sleeve pattern along the grainline of my fabric. \n\n3) BEFORE you take the pins out of your sleeve pieces, make a little notch using scissors for EVERY pleat line along the TOP of your sleeve. Don’t worry about doing this to the bottom because our pleats are going to end half down the sleeve. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo12-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo13-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n4) Now unpin and remove the pattern piece from your sleeves. \n\n5) Hem both of your sleeves by ironing and folding the bottom edge ¼” and then another ¼”, and edgestitch along the fold line to finish. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo14-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo15-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n6) Using your water soluble pen, draw a line from top to bottom on the front side of your fabric along the center of your sleeve. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo16-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n7) Draw another line on the back side of the fabric HORIZONALLTY measuring 4” from the hem. This will be your stopping line for each pleat as you sew them. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo17-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n8) Now following the notches we cut along the top of the sleeve, draw your pleats lines using a water soluble pen and a ruler, and make sure each line is ½” apart, moving from the center of the sleeve to the edge. Make sure to really draw your lines where the notches are! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo18-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n9) Once you have marked all your pleat lines, you’re ready to start sewing. Before you start sewing make sure you are folding the pleats in the right direction that you originally folded them, like I mentioned in step 9. You’ll know you’re folding them correctly if they fit together without any fabric sticking out along the top of the sleeve. Find your direction. \n\n10) Sewing these up is really easy. Get your iron set up and ready to go. You will fold the first pleat on the front side of the sleeve, skipping over one line (a fold line) and matching to the next line. (Covering three lines per pleat). Iron, but be careful not to iron the bottom part of your sleeve so it looks nice and flowy once it’s finished.\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo19-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo20-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo21-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n11) Now, turn your sleeve over to the back and sew along the fold you just made, stopping at the horizontal line we drew along the back of the sleeve. Make sure to backstitch at beginning and end of your stitching line. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo22-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo23-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo24-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n12) Repeat until both of your sleeves are finished! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo25-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo26-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo27-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n13) Sew the shoulder seams right sides together. Finish seam as desired. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo34-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n14) Now, along the top of each sleeve, sew one row of basting stitches. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo28-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n15) Attach your sleeve to the armhole, following the directions of you pattern, and sew in the sleeves. Finish the seam as desired. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo29-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo30-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo31-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n16) Finish the rest of the shirt as the pattern suggests, these instructions are specifically for the Key Largo Top by Hey June Patterns:\n\na. Sew up the side seams and under arm seam in one go. Finish Seam as desired. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo32-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nb. Hem the bottom of the shirt, and finish the neckline of the shirt as desired or according to your pattern. For my top, using the Key Largo pattern, I chose to finish the neckline with an exposed binding. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Pleated Sleeve](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/styled1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it! Happy sewing friends!\n\n",

Iron, but be careful not to iron the bottom part of your sleeve so it looks nice and flowy once it’s finished.</p>\n\n<p><p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo19-min.JPG\" alt=\"Pleated Sleeve\" />\n</p></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo20-min.JPG\" alt=\"Pleated Sleeve\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sara%20Project%20Pleated%20Sleeve/photo21-min.JPG\" alt=\"Pleated Sleeve\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>11) Now, turn your sleeve over to the back and sew along the fold you just made, stopping at the horizontal line we drew along the back of the sleeve.

Use the Right Needles & Thread\n\nFirst, you will want to make sure you are using the correct needles for your fabric.  Use brand new stretch needles for your machine type, whether it’s a sewing machine, serger, or coverstitch.  The stretch needles are really the key component in ensuring you don’t get those dreaded skipped stitches people sometimes encounter when sewing DBP.  All-purpose polyester thread is best.  If you are using a coverstitch machine to finish your hems, quality wooly nylon thread can be used for your looper thread.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DBP](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/wooly-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####2. Adjust Your Presser Foot Settings\n\nIf your machine has the capability of adjusting your presser foot’s pressure, try reducing the pressure.  This can help your fabric glide through easily while sewing.\n\n#####3. Use Correct Stitch Settings\n\nIf you are using a sewing machine, you will want to use a stretch stitch, lightning bolt stitch, or a narrow zigzag stitch.  I used a narrow zigzag for these white shorts with a width of .5 and a length of 3.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DBP](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/white-shorties-1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSergers already provide you with a seam that stretches.  On a coverstitch machine, use the same settings as for activewear knits, reducing your looper tension and increasing the stitch length to avoid tunneling.  Always test your machine settings on scraps until you get the correct ones for you.\n\n#####4. Know When and How to Press\n\nDon’t underestimate the importance of pressing your seams with plenty of steam.  A damp pressing cloth will protect the fabric and reduce seam impressions.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DBP](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/press-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####5. Make it Easier for Yourself with Notions\n\nAs always, there are a couple of tricks you can try to make sewing with DBP even easier.  Wonder Clips can be used to hold fabric seams together in place of pins when you’re sewing.\n\nFusible hem tapes can also help keep your hems looking lovely and crisp, and they make sewing easier too because the fabric isn’t stretching around underneath your presser foot.\n\nIf you’re hemming an area like a leg opening that needs to stretch when being worn, you can cut strips of fusible interfacing for knit that will allow hems to retain their stretch and still stabilize the fabric enough to make hemming a breeze.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DBP](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/Opal-1-1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe hope these tips help you feel ready to tackle DBP.  It really isn’t that different from other knits, and possibly even a bit easier because it doesn’t curl at the edges.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DBP](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/Opal-Dress-back-1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning how to sew with this deliciously soft fabric and will use it to fill your handmade wardrobe!",

Use the Right Needles &amp; Thread</h5>\n\n<p>First, you will want to make sure you are using the correct needles for your fabric.  Use brand new stretch needles for your machine type, whether it’s a sewing machine, serger, or coverstitch.  The stretch needles are really the key component in ensuring you don’t get those dreaded skipped stitches people sometimes encounter when sewing DBP.  All-purpose polyester thread is best.  If you are using a coverstitch machine to finish your hems, quality wooly nylon thread can be used for your looper thread.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/wooly-min.jpg\" alt=\"DBP\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"2adjustyourpresserfootsettings\">2. Adjust Your Presser Foot Settings</h5>\n\n<p>If your machine has the capability of adjusting your presser foot’s pressure, try reducing the pressure.  This can help your fabric glide through easily while sewing.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"3usecorrectstitchsettings\">3. Use Correct Stitch Settings</h5>\n\n<p>If you are using a sewing machine, you will want to use a stretch stitch, lightning bolt stitch, or a narrow zigzag stitch.  I used a narrow zigzag for these white shorts with a width of .5 and a length of 3.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/white-shorties-1-min.jpg\" alt=\"DBP\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sergers already provide you with a seam that stretches.  On a coverstitch machine, use the same settings as for activewear knits, reducing your looper tension and increasing the stitch length to avoid tunneling.  Always test your machine settings on scraps until you get the correct ones for you.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"4knowwhenandhowtopress\">4. Know When and How to Press</h5>\n\n<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of pressing your seams with plenty of steam.  A damp pressing cloth will protect the fabric and reduce seam impressions.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/press-min.jpg\" alt=\"DBP\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"5makeiteasierforyourselfwithnotions\">5. Make it Easier for Yourself with Notions</h5>\n\n<p>As always, there are a couple of tricks you can try to make sewing with DBP even easier.  Wonder Clips can be used to hold fabric seams together in place of pins when you’re sewing.</p>\n\n<p>Fusible hem tapes can also help keep your hems looking lovely and crisp, and they make sewing easier too because the fabric isn’t stretching around underneath your presser foot.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re hemming an area like a leg opening that needs to stretch when being worn, you can cut strips of fusible interfacing for knit that will allow hems to retain their stretch and still stabilize the fabric enough to make hemming a breeze.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/Opal-1-1-min.jpg\" alt=\"DBP\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>We hope these tips help you feel ready to tackle DBP.  It really isn’t that different from other knits, and possibly even a bit easier because it doesn’t curl at the edges.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Double%20Brushed%20Poly/Opal-Dress-back-1-min.jpg\" alt=\"DBP\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoyed learning how to sew with this deliciously soft fabric and will use it to fill your handmade wardrobe!</p>",

There is no shoulder seam for this pattern lay-out. However, should your fabric have a one-way orientation, you could cut two 40” x 28 ½” rectangles and add a shoulder seam. This pattern can be used with the fabric on grain (weft) or on the warp (vertical). The pattern layout shown is for fabric on the warp, which isn’t traditional, but works wonderfully for this kimono. \n\nFold the material in half, joining the two 40” sides together.\n\n\n####Step 2:\nFrom the folded edge, measure 10” down on either side of your folded piece of fabric – this is for the sleeves\n\nFrom the outside, measure 10” inward for the sleeve length.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Kimono%20cut%20out-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n\n#####Sew the side seams:\n* French seams for woven fabrics (clip at armpit corners) \n* Zig Zag stitch, Stretch stitch or surge ¼” seam allowance for knit fabrics\n \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Clip%20armpits-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Armpit%20velvet-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Step 3: \nDetermine where the middle point of the garment is and draw a line down the center on the top piece of fabric only. Based off that line, draw the 6” neck opening and taper down to the bottom center. Cut along the line drawn.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Kimono%20neck%20cut%20out-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n*Tip: Tailors chalk or a water soluble fabric pen is great to use because they are temporary. \n \n\n\n#####To finish the opening:\n* Use a 1” bias strip binding for woven fabrics\n* Top stitch a ¼” hem for knit fabrics. You can even leave it unfinished since most knits will not unravel. \n*Tip: Use a zig zag stitch or a stretch stitch with a walking foot to top stitch the ¼” hem. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Kimono%20necks-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4:\nHem the sleeve openings and kimono bottom edges. Hemming the edges of knit kimonos is optional if top-stitching fringe trim around the sleeves and bottom.\n\n####Step 5: \nI couldn’t resist spicing up this simple design with some fringe! \n\nFor the velvet kimono, I used 2 yards of 4” Tassel Fringe. \nFor the satin kimono, I used 2 yards of Victorian lace fringe.\n\nI attached them using a zig zag top stitch along the edge of the hemmed edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/kimono%20velvet%20fringe%20details-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Kimono%20floral%20fringe%20details-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n\nOnce you have finished your accessory, voila! You have a kimono. Wear it loose or closed with a brooch. You can wear it on its own or throw it over a shirt with a skirt or jeans. If you make it slightly longer, it makes a great throw-over to wear over a swimsuit.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kimono DIY](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kimono/Kimono%20floral%20hand%20pocket-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n \n \n \n\n",

Plus, my daughter loves having unique handmade items that set her apart from the crowd. And let's be honest, I really can't resist seeing her excitement over her handmade items!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Totes](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20%26%20Me%20Tote/IMG_1012-Edit-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nIsn't this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland\" target=\"_blank\">Wonderland fabric created by Rifle Paper Co. for Cotton + Steel</a> dreamy? I've been crushing on it ever since it released, so much so that I decided to make Mommy & Me bags.

A perfect knot is formed!\n\nThe video above shows you how to make a quilter's knot in more detail.\n\n####Bury the Knot:\nChoose a spot on your quilt a little ways away from where you want to begin your quilting. Insert your needle into the top of the quilt and through the batting, but DO NOT go out the back. Bring the point of your needle out where you want to start quilting. Draw your needle until the knot stops on the entrance point. Lightly tug until the knot goes through the entrance point and buries itself in the batting.

Draw your needle and thread all the way through, and repeat until you are finished with that line of quilting or you run out of thread.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hand Quilting](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hand%20Quilting/beginquilting1-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Ending your quilting:\nFor each piece of thread or line or quilting you have to finish it with another knot and bury it again.

                        "markdown": "Directional stretch and stretch percentage are important features when choosing the right fabric for your project. Some patterns will call out specifically the stretch percentage needed for the pattern to fit the best. Stretch fabrics can have mechanical stretch, in that they have a natural stretch based on the way they are made and do not include Lycra Spandex. Fabrics made with Lycra Spandex often have a greater stretch, and better recovery.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AmipTWJDVY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Stretch Direction:\n2 Way Stretch refers to fabric having one orientation of stretch. Most fabrics with 2 way stretch will have stretch horizontally, from selvedge to selvedge, with a few exceptions of fabrics designed to stretch only vertically along the selvedges. \n\nThe term “2 Way Stretch” seems like it should be called “1 Way Stretch” however, the origin of this term is based on stabilizing a portion of fabric, and being able to stretch two ways: to the right and and left. Or if it’s a fabric made to stretch vertically- that 2 way stretch would be referring to its ability to stretch up and down. Seems obvious that if fabric stretches one direction, it would also be able to stretch the opposing direction, but this is the basis for the terminology. \n\n4 Way stretch refers to when the fabric can stretch both vertically and horizontally. Stabilizing a point of the fabric, it will be able to stretch four ways: up, down, right and left. \n\n####How to stretch the fabric:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stretch](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/naturaltug-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTo properly determine fabric stretch, you must gently stretch the fabric and observe the recovery, similar to the performance needed as if it were made into a garment, going to be going over your head to put on, or fitting on your body. You wouldn’t want fabric to be stretched beyond its capacity when wearing it, so likewise, yanking on the fabric will not give you the best percentage estimate, and it will likely warp the fabric, compromising its quality. If the fabric becomes warped after stretching it, that is a clear indicator that it was stretched beyond its intention. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stretch](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/warped%20fabric-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Stretch Percentage:\nStretch percentage is estimated by stretching a fabric along a 4” -  8” ruler scale. Begin with fabric at ease on a 4” measurement, and stretch the fabric towards 8”. The measurement it comfortably reaches will indicate the percentage estimate. For example, this Art Gallery Skopelos Jersey Knit fabric can stretch to 6”. Since it stretched 2” past the 4” mark, and 2 is 50% of 4, then this fabric has 50% stretch. \n\n*Tip: Fold the fabric and stretch along the fold. Stretching fabric along a cut edge will not give the best estimate. Test the fabric perpendicular and parallel to the selvage to determine proper stretch direction and percentage. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stretch](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/20percent-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stretch](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/50percent-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n\n####Choose Your Fabric! \nDid you know that fabric.com offers stretch percentage estimates in our fabric descriptions, as well as a navigation option?

Or if it’s a fabric made to stretch vertically- that 2 way stretch would be referring to its ability to stretch up and down. Seems obvious that if fabric stretches one direction, it would also be able to stretch the opposing direction, but this is the basis for the terminology. </p>\n\n<p>4 Way stretch refers to when the fabric can stretch both vertically and horizontally. Stabilizing a point of the fabric, it will be able to stretch four ways: up, down, right and left. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"howtostretchthefabric\">How to stretch the fabric:</h4>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/naturaltug-min.PNG\" alt=\"Stretch\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>To properly determine fabric stretch, you must gently stretch the fabric and observe the recovery, similar to the performance needed as if it were made into a garment, going to be going over your head to put on, or fitting on your body. You wouldn’t want fabric to be stretched beyond its capacity when wearing it, so likewise, yanking on the fabric will not give you the best percentage estimate, and it will likely warp the fabric, compromising its quality. If the fabric becomes warped after stretching it, that is a clear indicator that it was stretched beyond its intention. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/warped%20fabric-min.PNG\" alt=\"Stretch\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"stretchpercentage\">Stretch Percentage:</h4>\n\n<p>Stretch percentage is estimated by stretching a fabric along a 4” -  8” ruler scale. Begin with fabric at ease on a 4” measurement, and stretch the fabric towards 8”. The measurement it comfortably reaches will indicate the percentage estimate. For example, this Art Gallery Skopelos Jersey Knit fabric can stretch to 6”. Since it stretched 2” past the 4” mark, and 2 is 50% of 4, then this fabric has 50% stretch. </p>\n\n<p>*Tip: Fold the fabric and stretch along the fold. Stretching fabric along a cut edge will not give the best estimate. Test the fabric perpendicular and parallel to the selvage to determine proper stretch direction and percentage. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/20percent-min.PNG\" alt=\"Stretch\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Stretch%20Percentage/50percent-min.PNG\" alt=\"Stretch\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chooseyourfabric\">Choose Your Fabric!</h4>\n\n<p>Did you know that fabric.com offers stretch percentage estimates in our fabric descriptions, as well as a navigation option?

The properties of the materials used in drop cloths are particularly handy for window treatment. When we saw this gorgeous fabric from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/lacefield-designs\" target=\"_blank\">Lacefield Designs</a>, we knew it would make the perfect drapes for our space!\n\nToday we'll teach you how to create these simple curtains yourself.

This tutorial will provide instructions for two easy hanging applications: a rod pocket or drapery clips. To measure where the bottom of the panel should hit, decide on one of four standard lengths: Sill, Apron, Floor and Puddle.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/cb-1961_curtainLengthDiagram-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Sill Length:\nCurtain length falls right below the window sill.\n\n\n#####Apron Length:\nCurtain length falls 4” below the window sill.\n\n\n#####Floor Length:\nCurtain length falls about ¼” above the floor.\n\n\n#####Puddle Legnth:\nCurtain length falls about 6 – 10 inches beyond floor length.  \n\n####Step 2\nOnce measurement of the finished length is determined, add 4” on top and bottom. The additional 8” will allow for a folded 3” hem on both ends. Buy extra yardage than needed for fabrics with motifs or print designs. When cutting the fabric, examine where the motif will be displayed, and cut accordingly so that each curtain panel matches. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/3%20inch%20hem-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nRoll hem the sides of the panels. \n\n####Step 4\nPress 1” inward on the top and bottom. Fold and press another 3” and top stitch across. Leave the sides open for the rod pocket. \n\n*Tip: Depending on the print orientation of the fabric, you can leave side seams open on both ends, so that there’s a rod pocket on both ends. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/rod%20pocket-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Step 5\nPress and hang!\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/Lacefield%20curtains%20-%20close%20up-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Best Fabrics for Drop Cloth Curtains\nHere are some fabrics we love for drop cloth curtains!\n\n#####Printed Cotton Duck\nPremier Prints makes medium weight cotton and cotton blend fabrics in amazing color patterns, and the cloth is not thick enough to completely block out light. Due to this and its bright colors, it also works well with modern furniture and suits small rooms where it can pull everything together. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/printed_cotton_duck_fabrics.jpg)\n</p>\n         \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uj-191/premier-prints-anderson-check-black-white\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Anderson Check Black/White</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0386970/premier-prints-winston-premier-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Winston Navy</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0334562/lacefield-bindi-large-paisley-slub-cobalt\" target=\"_blank\">Lacefield Bindi Large Paisley Slub Cobalt</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0277722/lacefield-monaco-sapphire\" target=\"_blank\">Lacefield Monaco Sapphire</a>\n\n \n#####Solid Canvas\nThis fabric is also 100% cotton and the fabric is of medium to heavy weight. As a result, it is perfect for window treatments including draperies, curtains and valances. It is worth noting, however, that its color options may vary due to the distinctive nature of the dyeing process used. Therefore, make sure you buy sufficient quantities to completely finish your project. \n \nThis fabric is perfect for roller shades and covering floor-to-ceiling windows in large rooms. Its dark shades complement large living rooms perfectly, especially with rustic, dark furniture to balance the antique look.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Drop Cloth Curtains](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/canvas_fabrics.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332737/93-oz-canvas-duck-aqua-sky\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Aqua Sky</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/es-169/93-oz-canvas-duck-natural\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Natural</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0519459/richloom-canvas-duck-optic-white\" target=\"_blank\">Richloom Canvas Optic White</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/el-263/93-oz-canvas-duck-gray\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Gray</a>\n\n\n#####Blackout Drapery\nBlackout drapery is a bestseller amongst drop cloth curtains, and with good reason. It muffles sound and reduces noises that might be released through the windows. As such, it is perfect for homes, nurseries, workplaces, and schools. This fabric can also insulate rooms according to season, making them cooler during the summer and warmer in winter.

The additional 8” will allow for a folded 3” hem on both ends. Buy extra yardage than needed for fabrics with motifs or print designs. When cutting the fabric, examine where the motif will be displayed, and cut accordingly so that each curtain panel matches. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/3%20inch%20hem-min.jpg\" alt=\"Drop Cloth Curtains\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step3\">Step 3</h4>\n\n<p>Roll hem the sides of the panels. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h4>\n\n<p>Press 1” inward on the top and bottom.

Due to this and its bright colors, it also works well with modern furniture and suits small rooms where it can pull everything together. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/printed_cotton_duck_fabrics.jpg\" alt=\"Drop Cloth Curtains\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uj-191/premier-prints-anderson-check-black-white\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Anderson Check Black/White</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0386970/premier-prints-winston-premier-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Winston Navy</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0334562/lacefield-bindi-large-paisley-slub-cobalt\" target=\"_blank\">Lacefield Bindi Large Paisley Slub Cobalt</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0277722/lacefield-monaco-sapphire\" target=\"_blank\">Lacefield Monaco Sapphire</a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"solidcanvas\">Solid Canvas</h5>\n\n<p>This fabric is also 100% cotton and the fabric is of medium to heavy weight. As a result, it is perfect for window treatments including draperies, curtains and valances. It is worth noting, however, that its color options may vary due to the distinctive nature of the dyeing process used. Therefore, make sure you buy sufficient quantities to completely finish your project. </p>\n\n<p>This fabric is perfect for roller shades and covering floor-to-ceiling windows in large rooms. Its dark shades complement large living rooms perfectly, especially with rustic, dark furniture to balance the antique look.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Drop%20Cloth%20Curtains%20DIY/canvas_fabrics.jpg\" alt=\"Drop Cloth Curtains\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0332737/93-oz-canvas-duck-aqua-sky\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Aqua Sky</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/es-169/93-oz-canvas-duck-natural\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Natural</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0519459/richloom-canvas-duck-optic-white\" target=\"_blank\">Richloom Canvas Optic White</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/el-263/93-oz-canvas-duck-gray\" target=\"_blank\">9.3 oz Canvas Gray</a></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"blackoutdrapery\">Blackout Drapery</h5>\n\n<p>Blackout drapery is a bestseller amongst drop cloth curtains, and with good reason.

Fold your fabric in order to easily cut bias strips. Cut 14-16 bias strips. 1” x 18” strips (14 -16) 14 is better for thicker fabrics, and 16 for thinner fabrics. \n\n#####Then cut:\n* 1” x 30” strip (1)\n* 1” x 15” strip (1)\n* 1” x 18” strip (1) This is to join the tassels and form the head. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tassel Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/join_tassels-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPlace the 1” x 15” strip horizontally first, place the 14-16 strips perpendicular, with the 30” strip placed last. Tie the 15” strip, joining all the other strips. Tie the 30” strip roughly 11” times in the center and knot once, this is to provide structure bulk for the head of the tassel. Take the original 1” x 15” strip, tie around, and double knot to form the top of the tassel head and to serve as the tassel attachment. Use an additional 1” x 18” strip to join the tassels and knot twice. Fluff, and trim. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tassel Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/finished_tassel-min.PNG)\n</p>\n \n1 ½ yard of 45” fabric makes approximately 4 tassels using the technique shown. Make as many or as few as you want. The blanket shown has 10 tassels total of three coordinating fabrics.\n\n####Cut the accent fabric:\nCut 7” bias strips and join them together to equal two 7” x 65” strips. Press one side ½” inward. \n\n####Attaching the Tassels:\nOn each cut edge of the fleece fabric, pin your tassels evenly along the edges and corners. With right sides together, pin the accent fabric to the fleece, with the tassels sandwiched in the middle.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tassel Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/pin-min.PNG)\n</p>\n \nUsing a walking foot, sew a shallow zig zag stitch and a 3/8” seam allowance. When stitching over the tassels, back stitch to re-inforce the tassels. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tassel Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/zig_zag_stitch.PNG)\n</p>\n\n\nTrim the excess tassel fabric within the seam allowance. Flip the accent fabric outward, so that wrong sides are together. \n\nPin and top stitch using a shallow zig zag with a walking foot. \n\nFold the excess fabric on the sides inward in order to top stitch them as well.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tassel Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/top_stitch-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n\nVoila!

Cut 14-16 bias strips. 1” x 18” strips (14 -16) 14 is better for thicker fabrics, and 16 for thinner fabrics. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"thencut\">Then cut:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1” x 30” strip (1)</li>\n<li>1” x 15” strip (1)</li>\n<li>1” x 18” strip (1) This is to join the tassels and form the head. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/join_tassels-min.PNG\" alt=\"Tassel Blanket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Place the 1” x 15” strip horizontally first, place the 14-16 strips perpendicular, with the 30” strip placed last. Tie the 15” strip, joining all the other strips. Tie the 30” strip roughly 11” times in the center and knot once, this is to provide structure bulk for the head of the tassel. Take the original 1” x 15” strip, tie around, and double knot to form the top of the tassel head and to serve as the tassel attachment. Use an additional 1” x 18” strip to join the tassels and knot twice. Fluff, and trim. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/finished_tassel-min.PNG\" alt=\"Tassel Blanket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>1 ½ yard of 45” fabric makes approximately 4 tassels using the technique shown. Make as many or as few as you want. The blanket shown has 10 tassels total of three coordinating fabrics.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cuttheaccentfabric\">Cut the accent fabric:</h4>\n\n<p>Cut 7” bias strips and join them together to equal two 7” x 65” strips. Press one side ½” inward. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"attachingthetassels\">Attaching the Tassels:</h4>\n\n<p>On each cut edge of the fleece fabric, pin your tassels evenly along the edges and corners. With right sides together, pin the accent fabric to the fleece, with the tassels sandwiched in the middle.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/pin-min.PNG\" alt=\"Tassel Blanket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Using a walking foot, sew a shallow zig zag stitch and a 3/8” seam allowance. When stitching over the tassels, back stitch to re-inforce the tassels. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/zig_zag_stitch.PNG\" alt=\"Tassel Blanket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Trim the excess tassel fabric within the seam allowance. Flip the accent fabric outward, so that wrong sides are together. </p>\n\n<p>Pin and top stitch using a shallow zig zag with a walking foot. </p>\n\n<p>Fold the excess fabric on the sides inward in order to top stitch them as well.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fleece%20Tassel%20Blanket/top_stitch-min.PNG\" alt=\"Tassel Blanket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Voila!

One of our resident fabric.com pups, Buddy, is sporting Dallas Cowboys spirit, but you can browse all of your favorite team's fabric in our <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-the-team-shop.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Team Shop by clicking here</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_7332-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n###Reversible Bandana Project\nThese bandanas are reversible, so you can even showcase two different teams if you'd like! Best of all, the bandana slips right onto your pet's collar. We decided to use two coordinating broadcloth fabrics featuring the same team for our bandana.\n\n####Supplies Needed:\n* 2 <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-the-team-shop.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">team fabrics</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ck-212/nfl-cotton-broadcloth-dallas-cowboys-white\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dl-961/nfl-cotton-broadcloth-dallas-cowboys-blue\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>)\n* Coordinating <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>  (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-6045/aurifil-quilting-thread-50wt-grey\" target=\"_blank\">Aurifil Grey</a>)\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Cutting supplies</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Rotary cutter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Ruler</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Cutting Mat</a>\n\n####Instructions\nWe are using the measurements from Buddy’s collar and neck. Use your own pet’s measurements in the parentheses for a custom sized bandana.\n\nMeasure your pet’s collar – the width of it at the widest part. Remember to allow for buckles and other hardware if they add to the width. We are using 1” for Buddy’s – add a ½” for allowance.\n\nBuddy’s collar and neck measure 19” around – you want the longest part of the bandana (the hypotenuse of the triangle) to be shorter than this measurement. \n\nUse a ¼” seam allowance throughout.\n\nCut two squares “on point”, like so. We cut 12.5” squares. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2982-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2984-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nCut them in half for two triangles with the patterns facing the way the bandana will lie.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2985-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nAt the corners, cut in your width measurement +1/2”, for us – that’s (1.5”)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2986-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYour bandana triangles will look like this\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2987-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSew your bandana triangles together along the flat side with right sides together. Press seam open or to the darker fabric.\n\nTake the remaining flat sides and turn under ¼” and then another ¼”. Edgestitch down, remembering the backstitch at the beginning and ends for durability.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2989-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFold right sides together. Beginning at the flat opening, sew around the open sides, pivoting at the point for a sharp corner. Remember to leave the openings unstitched!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2991-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nclip the point of the bandana like so...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2992-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTurn right side out through either opening. Topstitch along top edge, and (1.5”) down to create a channel across the bandana for the collar. You can also topstitch along the sides for a professional finish.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_2998-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFeed the collar through the channel with your favorite side facing out. Now you are ready to cheer on your team!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_3002-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/IMG_7285-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n###Team Fleece & Minky Blanket\nNow let's make an easy and super cozy fleece and Minky blanket for those chilly autumn games!\n\n####Supplies Needed:\n* 1.5 yards <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-the-team-shop.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">team fleece fabric</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ck-173/nfl-fleece-dallas-cowboys-toss-blue-white\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>)\n* 1.5 yards <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cuddle-fleece\" target=\"_blank\">Minky Cuddle Fleece</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430624/shannon-cuddle-fleece-silver\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>) \n* Coordinating <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-6045/aurifil-quilting-thread-50wt-grey\" target=\"_blank\">Aurifil Grey</a>) \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-309/schmetz-ball-point-machine-needle-assortment\" target=\"_blank\">Ball point needles</a> \n* <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Foxnovo-Sewing-Machine-Walking-Brother/dp/B00K5LOM9O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502986572&sr=8-1&keywords=walking+foot\" target=\"_blank\">Walking foot</a> \n\nYou can sew this with a regular foot and needles, but it will be much easier with a walking foot and ball point needle since Minky is a tad stretchy and is prone to shift.\n\n####Instructions\nLay your Minky out on top of your fleece, right sides together. Trim the cut edges to match, and then trim the fleece width to match the minky width. Pin around the edges.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/cb-1980_IMG_2961-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/cb-1980_IMG_2962-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![NFL Pet Bandana & Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/NFL%20Pet%20Bandana%20and%20Blanket/cb-1980_IMG_2963-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith a walking foot, ball point needle, and zig zag stitch, sew around the edges of the blanket at around 1” seam allowance, backstitching when you begin and end.

Laura here from <a href=\"http://www.trashtocouture.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Trash to Couture</a> and I'm excited to share this DIY home decor project with you!\n\nMy family and I just moved into a new home in Atlanta from Boulder, Colorado and it has inspired me to sew more home decor projects then my usual fashion designs.  I wanted to bring some of the western boho style of Colorado into our traditional southern home.  \n\nI’ve been on the hunt for fabric that represents this style: geometric prints, vibrant colors, and indigo shades. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Justina Blakeney</a>'s new line of fabrics seemed to check off all boxes. I actually had a hard time cutting into the fabric as it was so beautiful! The fabrics are great stand alone pieces you can use for rugs, wall tapestrys, headboards and even as a throw blanket over the couch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/SM-Justina-Blakeney_Fabrics-5.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/justinaBlakeney_red_7.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI had some time to think about what types of decor I wanted to DIY, and will be sharing a few of these projects exclusively with fabric.com! First, I wanted to make a fabric basket which is great for storage of all kinds: books, sewing supplies, fabric, blankets, etc.  Both are great projects to customize fit and style.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/basket%20final%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Justina Blakeney</a> fabric is heavyweight and perfect for projects like these! \n\nFollow the tutorial below and sew your own!\n\n####Supplies:\n\n* 1 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Justina Blakeney</a> Fabric\n* 1 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0307093/pellon-tp971f-fusible-thermolam-plus-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon fusible fleece</a>\n* 1 yard interior <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>\n* General sewing supplies\n \n \n####Cutting:\n\n* 2 exterior pieces: 18\" x 18.5\"\n* 2 interior pieces: 18\" x 18.5\"\n* 2 fusible interfacing pieces: 18\" x 18.5\"\n* 2 straps: 4\" x 8\"\n\n####Instructions:\n \nCut out your pattern pieces. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%201-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nIron your fusible interfacing on the liner according to the product instructions. I usually do this on the exterior fabric but the heavy weight fabric I'm using makes it hard to bind the adhesive side so the liner works for this. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step2.jpg)\n</p>\n \nTake both your interior pieces and place right sides together. Sew both sides and bottom but leave a 4\" opening at the bottom.  For the exterior so both sides and bottom. Make sure to leave a top opening for both. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMark and cut a 4\" square on each corner of the interior and exterior and cut each of them out. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%204-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nThey will appear like this...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%205-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFold the bottom seam up to meet the side seam of all 4 corners including the exterior and liner. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%206-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin into place and sew along the edge. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%207-min.JPG)\n</p>\n \nAs you sew finger press the seams toward the same side. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%208-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nThey both should look like this...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%209-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFlip the exterior piece right side out. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2010-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nCreate your straps. I folded my strips in half, sewed right sides together using a 1/4\" seam allowance. Then I used a loop turner to flip the right side out. You can press so the seam lies in the middle of the back. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2011-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace your straps so the right sides are together against the exterior body. Position them so there is a 1\" gap from the side seam.  Then baste stitch them along the top edge to hold them in place. \n \nThis is optional but I LOVED the fringe selvage of the fabric so I folded it over 1/4\" and top stitch it down. I did have to posting the straps over the folded trim. Again, totally optional but if you want to add this detail this is how I did it. You'll see it's like this in the final as well.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2013-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPlace the exterior right side out into the liner so the right sides are together.  Line them up and and pin so the side seams are matching.  Sew all the way around make sure to sew the straps in as well.  I'd do a 1/2\" seam allowance if you didn't do the fringe edge. If you did the fringe border sew a 1/4\" seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2014-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nNow use that opening you left at the bottom of the liner to flip everything out through this.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2015-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2016-min.JPG)\n</p>\n \nSew the liner opening closed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2017.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2018.JPG)\n</p>\n \nIt will look like this. You will now want to sew down the top edge and create a bit more stability in the straps and overall structure. To do this just top stitch along the top edge exterior.  Start at one of the side seams and make sure the straps are upright when sewing. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2019.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2020.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Fabric Basket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/DSC_1949-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nNow go make 10 in all different sizes and prints! You can change the width and length just by altering the above measurements. \n\n",

Make sure to leave a top opening for both. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%203-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Mark and cut a 4\" square on each corner of the interior and exterior and cut each of them out. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%204-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>They will appear like this...</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%205-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Fold the bottom seam up to meet the side seam of all 4 corners including the exterior and liner. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%206-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Pin into place and sew along the edge. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%207-min.JPG\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>As you sew finger press the seams toward the same side. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%208-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>They both should look like this...</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%209-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Flip the exterior piece right side out. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2010-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Create your straps. I folded my strips in half, sewed right sides together using a 1/4\" seam allowance. Then I used a loop turner to flip the right side out. You can press so the seam lies in the middle of the back. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2011-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Place your straps so the right sides are together against the exterior body. Position them so there is a 1\" gap from the side seam.  Then baste stitch them along the top edge to hold them in place. </p>\n\n<p>This is optional but I LOVED the fringe selvage of the fabric so I folded it over 1/4\" and top stitch it down. I did have to posting the straps over the folded trim. Again, totally optional but if you want to add this detail this is how I did it. You'll see it's like this in the final as well.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2013-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Place the exterior right side out into the liner so the right sides are together.  Line them up and and pin so the side seams are matching.  Sew all the way around make sure to sew the straps in as well.  I'd do a 1/2\" seam allowance if you didn't do the fringe edge. If you did the fringe border sew a 1/4\" seam allowance.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2014-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now use that opening you left at the bottom of the liner to flip everything out through this.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2015-min.JPG\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2016-min.JPG\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew the liner opening closed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2017.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2018.JPG\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>It will look like this. You will now want to sew down the top edge and create a bit more stability in the straps and overall structure. To do this just top stitch along the top edge exterior.  Start at one of the side seams and make sure the straps are upright when sewing. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2019.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/step%2020.JPG\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Fabric%20Basket/DSC_1949-min.jpg\" alt=\"DIY Fabric Basket\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Now go make 10 in all different sizes and prints!

Measured Knit Band:\n This technique takes the longest, but yields the greatest reward! You can opt to use this standard formula (opening measurement X .09) to determine the length of the band, or you can simply take the knit band strip, and physically measure it against the opening it will be sewn onto. I prefer the latter, since every fabric stretches differently, and I can visually determine the performance of the fabric. Gently tug the strip along the opening, add room for seam allowance, and cut. When joining the knit band, angle the seam so that the band will lay flat against the body when worn. Pin the folded band along the opening, and sew. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/measured%20knit%20band-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####2.\tSeamed Knit Band:\n \nThis technique is very popular because there’s no measuring involved, and it’s preferred when binding edges that are too small to do a measured knit band easily, like kid’s clothes. Attach the folded strip by gently stretching the band as you attach it to the garment. If you stretch too much, it will create puckers in the garment, fit poorly, and it could bend your needle from pulling the fabric too hard as it’s being sewn. Gently stretching the band is very beneficial for a proper fit on the garment. If the band isn’t applied this way, gaping arm holes and neck holes are a risk. Once the band is applied, simply trim the excess to match the angles of the side seam or shoulder seam, and sew closed. Bartack the seam allowance to finish so it lays flat.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/seamedd%20knit%20band-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#### 3. Overlap Knit Band:\n \nThis technique gives the finish of a measured knit band, without the measuring. This one requires a bit more sewing experience, because the band has to be manipulated as it’s being sewn. Before applying the band to the opening, clip a graduated angle on one end. Pin the band to the opening, to where the full length of the folded band lands on the seam of the garment. Serge or zig zag while gently stretching the band. When you reach the point of the start of the angled knit band, begin tapering off the band to overlap another angle. If you’re using a serger, the serger will trim the excess to create the angle. When using a sewing machine, pull the knit band off, so that the zig zag stitch stays in line, then trim the excess fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/overlapping%20knit%20band-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/knit_bands_moneyshot_2-min.PNG)\n</p> \n\n\n####Top Stitching (Optional):\n \nTop stitching for these knit band techniques is optional. The decision to topstitch is based on how the fabric will perform, how the garment will be cared for, and sewing skill level. Top stitching does require a high level of control in order to get that perfect line. It can be easier than you think, especially with a little practice. For this stretchy cotton knit fabric, I used a 14/90 stretch needle (stretch needles are best for avoiding skipped stitches on stretchy fabric), and a basic straight stitch. No stretch-stitch required, since the stability comes from stitching 4 or more layers of fabric. Practice a few of these options:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/Top%20stitch%20options-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Top Stitch Knit Band:\n \n\nSimply top stitch to secure the seam allowance. This will allow the neck and arm openings to lay flat consistently. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/top%20stitch-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\n\n####Clean Finish and Seam-Covered Binding:\n \nMy personal favorite. Depending on whether the knit band is sewn to the right side of the fabric or the wrong side of the fabric, determines what part of the band will show. If sewn to the right side, no band will show. If applied to the wrong side, the band will show. Either way, the seam allowance for applying the band initially is totally concealed. To do this, wrap the knit band around the seam allowance, and edge stitch to secure. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/clean%20finish-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\n\n####\tNarrow Seam Covered Band:\n \nSimilar to the clean finish band, this one plays off the natural fold of the knit band, making it a little easier to top stitch. Fold the knit band inward about ¼” and topstitch. A small portion of the seam allowance may be visible from the inside only. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Attaching Knit Bands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/narrow%20knit-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\nHappy sewing!\n\n",

You can opt to use this standard formula (opening measurement X .09) to determine the length of the band, or you can simply take the knit band strip, and physically measure it against the opening it will be sewn onto. I prefer the latter, since every fabric stretches differently, and I can visually determine the performance of the fabric. Gently tug the strip along the opening, add room for seam allowance, and cut. When joining the knit band, angle the seam so that the band will lay flat against the body when worn. Pin the folded band along the opening, and sew. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/measured%20knit%20band-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2seamedknitband\">2.    Seamed Knit Band:</h4>\n\n<p>This technique is very popular because there’s no measuring involved, and it’s preferred when binding edges that are too small to do a measured knit band easily, like kid’s clothes. Attach the folded strip by gently stretching the band as you attach it to the garment. If you stretch too much, it will create puckers in the garment, fit poorly, and it could bend your needle from pulling the fabric too hard as it’s being sewn. Gently stretching the band is very beneficial for a proper fit on the garment. If the band isn’t applied this way, gaping arm holes and neck holes are a risk. Once the band is applied, simply trim the excess to match the angles of the side seam or shoulder seam, and sew closed. Bartack the seam allowance to finish so it lays flat.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/seamedd%20knit%20band-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3overlapknitband\">3. Overlap Knit Band:</h4>\n\n<p>This technique gives the finish of a measured knit band, without the measuring. This one requires a bit more sewing experience, because the band has to be manipulated as it’s being sewn. Before applying the band to the opening, clip a graduated angle on one end. Pin the band to the opening, to where the full length of the folded band lands on the seam of the garment. Serge or zig zag while gently stretching the band. When you reach the point of the start of the angled knit band, begin tapering off the band to overlap another angle. If you’re using a serger, the serger will trim the excess to create the angle. When using a sewing machine, pull the knit band off, so that the zig zag stitch stays in line, then trim the excess fabric. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/overlapping%20knit%20band-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/knit_bands_moneyshot_2-min.PNG\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"topstitchingoptional\">Top Stitching (Optional):</h4>\n\n<p>Top stitching for these knit band techniques is optional. The decision to topstitch is based on how the fabric will perform, how the garment will be cared for, and sewing skill level. Top stitching does require a high level of control in order to get that perfect line. It can be easier than you think, especially with a little practice. For this stretchy cotton knit fabric, I used a 14/90 stretch needle (stretch needles are best for avoiding skipped stitches on stretchy fabric), and a basic straight stitch. No stretch-stitch required, since the stability comes from stitching 4 or more layers of fabric. Practice a few of these options:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/Top%20stitch%20options-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"topstitchknitband\">Top Stitch Knit Band:</h4>\n\n<p>Simply top stitch to secure the seam allowance. This will allow the neck and arm openings to lay flat consistently. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/top%20stitch-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"cleanfinishandseamcoveredbinding\">Clean Finish and Seam-Covered Binding:</h4>\n\n<p>My personal favorite. Depending on whether the knit band is sewn to the right side of the fabric or the wrong side of the fabric, determines what part of the band will show. If sewn to the right side, no band will show. If applied to the wrong side, the band will show. Either way, the seam allowance for applying the band initially is totally concealed. To do this, wrap the knit band around the seam allowance, and edge stitch to secure. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/clean%20finish-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"narrowseamcoveredband\">Narrow Seam Covered Band:</h4>\n\n<p>Similar to the clean finish band, this one plays off the natural fold of the knit band, making it a little easier to top stitch. Fold the knit band inward about ¼” and topstitch. A small portion of the seam allowance may be visible from the inside only. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Attaching%20Knit%20Bands/narrow%20knit-min.jpg\" alt=\"Attaching Knit Bands\" />\n</p> \n\n<p>Happy sewing!</p>",

Fabric A is the largest ring in your quilt, B the middle and C the inside.   See the diagram below.\n\nFrom the white background fabric cut x5 8.5in x WOF strips.   Sub-cut into x24 8.5in squares.\n\nFrom Fabric A, cut x3 8.5in x WOF strips.  Sub-cut into x13 8.5in squares.\n\nFrom Fabric B, cut x2 8.5in x WOF strips.  Sub-cut into x8 8.5in squares.\n\nFrom Fabric C, cut x4 8.5in x WOF strips.  Sub-cut into x4 8.5in squares.   Set aside remaining strips for borders.\n\nCut the binding fabric into x7 2.5in x WOF strips.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Greatest Granny Square](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Greatest%20Granny%20Square%20Quilt/Fig1%20copy.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####Assemble the quilt top\nArrange your cut fabric squares into the granny square block as shown in the diagram.   Sew together in rows using a 1/4in seam allowance.  Press each row in the opposite direction (see arrows) for nesting your seams.  \n\nTo make the top and bottom borders, sew together the remaining C strips.  Cut into x2 8.5in x 56.5in pieces.\n\nAdd borders to top and bottom and sew together rows to make quilt top.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Greatest Granny Square](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Greatest%20Granny%20Square%20Quilt/quiltylove-9257-2-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\nPrepare your backing fabric by folding in half width wise and cutting at fold.  Sew together the two pieces using a 1/2 in seam allowance.  Press seam.\n\nBaste your quilt by placing the backing right side down, adding your batting and placing your quilt top right side up.  Pin or spray baste in place.\n\nQuilt by outlining each seam on both sides using a walking foot.\n\nBind your quilt.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Greatest Granny Square](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Greatest%20Granny%20Square%20Quilt/quiltylove-9261-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\nFrom your binding fabric, cut x7 2.5in x WOF strips.  Sew them together end to end.  Fold your binding wrong sides together length wise and press.   Attach the binding to the quilt.\n\nThe Greatest Granny Square quilt top can be completed in an afternoon.  It’s large scale allows it to go together quickly.

                        "markdown": "Hello again! It's me, Jessica from <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a>. I'm so thankful to be back here on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> to tell you all about a slipcover I made recently.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/1.0-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nBy \"I\" I mean myself and a super sweet and amazing friend, Melissa, that shares my love for jumping in, winging it and correcting along the way. I tell you that because before you say you can't do this project, I say, try it. Really, we were pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to make and we think it's worth a shot. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/1.2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe recovered this wing back chair that my family affectionately refers to as 'Papa's Chair'. It was my great grandfathers, then my parents and my mom passed it down to us. At least as far back as I can remember I've seen it with a pink plaid upholstery job, a burgundy slip cover and then about 7 years ago, I worked with a friend's sweet grandmother to upholster it in this brown scroll fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/2.0-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUpholstery is hard. I have so much respect for people who do it well and totally understand why the pricing is what it is. It's hard work. It was done well thanks to my friend but I was so relieved to try a slipcover this time.\n\n####Supplies Needed\nThe fabric I picked for my slipcover is <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/premier-prints-style-zoey\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Zoey</a> Cove. Cove is the color name and it's a taupey grey. There is also 'clay' which looks to be more grey. Cove is warmer.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/2.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI looked at <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>'s yardage chart estimator and checked a few others and ended up ordering 9 yards. \nNote: I didn't use all 9 but I got nervous and rounded up!\n\n#####You'll Need:\n* ~9 Yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> home decor fabric</a>\n* Scissors\n* Pins\n* Sewing machine\n* Thread\n* Pencil\n* Seam ripper\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Instructions:\nFirst I washed and dried the fabric. I'm so bad about skipping this step when I'm doing small projects. It was especially important this time because all this work would go to waste if it shrunk up the first time I washed it...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe draped the fabric (right side down) over the chair making sure it almost touched the floor in the back, touched the seat of the chair and went almost to the floor in the front too. I trimmed the width I needed and then trimmed the length.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/5.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext we took a scrap of what I cut off from the width and draped it from the seat of the chair over the wing and down to the floor. The angles get confusing on the wing but you just want to make sure the fabric's print is sitting straight, not on a diagonal.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/5.0-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhen we had the fabric where we wanted them on the wings, I pinned the fabric closed around it and trimmed off the extra material.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/7.0-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext to that, I pinned where the wing fabric met the section in the inside corner of the chair.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/7.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLet me stop right here and tell you. pins, pins, pins. They're your best friend for this. Make sure you have a bunch on hand.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/8.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThen we draped fabric over the arms in the same way. From the floor, over the arm, down to the seat. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/8.2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe chose to cut separate pieces for the front of the chair arms.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/9-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI began with a rectangular scrap. I used pins and joined it with the arm piece starting from the bottom of the chair up and around the curve of the arm, and back to the bottom.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/10-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/11.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom here, each section was complete.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/12-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/5.3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCompletely pinned. We carefully pulled it off of the chair and I began to sew the lines that I was positive about. Its a huge slip cover full of weird angles so as soon as it came off of its form, it was hard to recognize what went where.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/13-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhen I got to an angle that seemed tricky or didn't make sense, I just stopped sewing and went to another section. I realize this proves that I had no idea what I was doing. A pro would probably never do this. But it also proves that you can do it. Just with lots of guess and check.\n\nAfter the first round of sewing, we put the cover back on, re-pinned some spots that I needed clarification a little more help with.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/5.2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the inside corners, where we couldn't fit any pins, we used a colored pencil to mark a line to make it easier to sew.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/14-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/14.1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThen more sewing. At this point, I had gotten most of the pieces sewn in the right spot and we were able to flip it right side out and see a preview of our handiwork.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/15-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCue high fives and pats on the back! Clearly we weren't lacking self esteem that day.\n\nWe did have to make a few more adjustments but really the hardest part about all of that is pulling the slipcover on and off.\n\nCushion time.  Melissa cut out two squares about 2\" wider than the dimensions of the cushion.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/17-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThen cut a long and skinny piece that was the height of the cushion (+ 2\" for seam allowance) and the length of the perimeter of the cushion with an extra 6 inches to create an envelope enclosure.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/18-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe matched a cushion corner with the trim corner, pinned and sewed almost all the way around. Lined up the bottom cushion piece and did the same thing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/13-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe decided to make it an envelope enclosure because zippers are scary. ; )  We hemmed the top and bottom ends, folded them in, one on top of the other, and sewed them to the side edge. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/30-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/31-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/32-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLAST THING! I promise.  For the super unfancy skirt, I cut rectangles 7\" tall and then 2 at the width of the chair and 2 at the depth of the chair.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/34.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI hemmed the sides and bottom of each peice.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/35.jpg)\n</p>\n \nThen pinned them to the bottom of the slip cover (right sides together) making sure the skirt grazed the ground evenly on all sides. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/36.jpg)\n</p>\n \nI pulled the cover off, sewed one long line, one last time then that was it!\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/37.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis project took us a little less than a school day and the addition of the skirt over the weekend. I am so happy with how it turned out!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/21-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI chose to have the dot pattern going horizontal on the back of the chair, seat of the chair, the tops of the arms and the front view of the wings. This lends to the pattern looking different on the sides. I was completely fine with this. In fact, I like that its uniform but there is a bit more interest in certain areas. It would be the easiest to sew with fabric that has no direction but I CANNOT, NOT DO PATTERN. Solid is so hard for me. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/22-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/23-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/24-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe chair is so much lighter and brighter now. I love the modern fabric and the neutral design.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/25-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/26-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI honestly can't believe we did it ourselves. Not because it's perfect because it's not. It's obviously not. But it looks great to me. It gives me the updated look I wanted and the job is DONE!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/21-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI hope this has inspired you to give a slipcover a go. You really CAN do this. Get a friend that's willing to help and make a fun day of it. It was a great day and I'm so thankful.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wingback Chair Slipcover](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/27-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n\n\n",

For the super unfancy skirt, I cut rectangles 7\" tall and then 2 at the width of the chair and 2 at the depth of the chair.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/34.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I hemmed the sides and bottom of each peice.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/35.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Then pinned them to the bottom of the slip cover (right sides together) making sure the skirt grazed the ground evenly on all sides. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/36.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I pulled the cover off, sewed one long line, one last time then that was it!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/37.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This project took us a little less than a school day and the addition of the skirt over the weekend. I am so happy with how it turned out!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/20-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/21-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I chose to have the dot pattern going horizontal on the back of the chair, seat of the chair, the tops of the arms and the front view of the wings. This lends to the pattern looking different on the sides. I was completely fine with this. In fact, I like that its uniform but there is a bit more interest in certain areas. It would be the easiest to sew with fabric that has no direction but I CANNOT, NOT DO PATTERN. Solid is so hard for me. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/22-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/23-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/24-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The chair is so much lighter and brighter now. I love the modern fabric and the neutral design.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/25-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/26-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I honestly can't believe we did it ourselves. Not because it's perfect because it's not. It's obviously not. But it looks great to me. It gives me the updated look I wanted and the job is DONE!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/21-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I hope this has inspired you to give a slipcover a go. You really CAN do this. Get a friend that's willing to help and make a fun day of it. It was a great day and I'm so thankful.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Wingback%20Chair%20Slipcover/27-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wingback Chair Slipcover\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy sewing!</p>",

I am so excited to be here today to bring you a fabulous project that I just finished up featuring <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/telio\" target=\"_blank\">TÉLIO</a> fabrics.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis project is all about color! I can't think of a single color I don't like to sew with or wear. I definitely have favorites that I wear a lot, but it's hard to think of a color that I make a concerted effort to avoid, or that I just don't care for. I've spent a great deal of time looking for the right color fabric over the years too. Navy must be rich and dark, not vintage or faded looking, yellow should be bright without being gaudy or cheap looking, and reds should be true red - not too orange, not too blue. Emerald is a color I love, especially for fall, and it's a color I think I wear well. (After a summer in lots of white, I'm reminded thanks to all the pictures I take that white is actually not a great color on me. So, moving forward: less white, more bold colors. Hold me to it.)\n\nI found <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0266988/telio-viscose-rayon-challis-emerald\" target=\"_blank\">this fabric</a> on fabric.com, and the moment I saw it I not only squealed with delight at having finally found the perfect shade of emerald! It's 100% Viscose Rayon, 56\" wide, and it's machine washable.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Large_0266988.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald18-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRayon (also called viscose) is made from wood pulp, a naturally occurring, cellulose-based raw material. I like it because its characteristics are similar to that of linen and cotton, and it is beyond comfortable to wear in the Texas heat. \n\nI love the drape of viscose batiste or challis, and it's easy to work with and launder. It also retains color well, which is why you can find such rich colors in a rayon fabrication. It doesn't pill unless the fabric is made from short, low-twist yarns (I've never had a rayon that even remotely pilled), and it doesn't build up static electricity. Rayon does, however, wrinkle so loose fitting garments are best (full skirts and dresses, flowy tops, and scarves). Bemberg rayon is also a fantastic option for linings. I choose it over polyester or acetate every time.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald21-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald22-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis particular rayon is a batiste, so it's especially lightweight and drapes exceptionally well. It's opaque enough to forgo a lining, which is great. Use a little extra care when you cut it out, because it can be a tad slippery (no edges hanging off your cutting table!), and I would also pin your pieces together in one or two additional areas just to ensure it doesn't move around as you sew it. \n\nI used a size 70 universal needle, all purpose thread, and I serged all the raw edges. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-101-french-seams/\" target=\"_blank\">French seams</a> would also be lovely. I let the dress rest on the dress form overnight to let the bias fall, then I leveled it and hemmed it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald17-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI used an out-of-print pattern, Butterick 5878, and I replaced the tiered skirt with a full circle skirt for the most movement.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald5-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor those of us in warmer climates where seasons take their sweet time arriving (or don't change at all), color is a great way to dress for the season without layering or piling on coats or things that don't make sense for the weather. So, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0266988/telio-viscose-rayon-challis-emerald\" target=\"_blank\">this emerald viscose</a> makes for one seriously pretty dress, and I can ease my way into fall without looking ridiculous. \n\nConsidering how much I love this color, I'm surprised that this dress is the first garment in this color I have in my closet. I think I'm looking at a fall season jam packed with emerald green!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Telio Brand Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Telio%20Collection%3A%20Enchanting%20Emerald/Emerald14-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n\n",

                        "markdown": "Created by: <a href=\"http://www.thelatesew.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Late Sew</a>\n\nHello lovely fabric.com friends! My name is Vienna and I have a little blog called The Late Sew (I only sew late at night, because motherhood), and I’m so excited to be here today talking about this amazing new digitally printed rayon challis. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric.com</a> has several brand new beautiful prints to choose from and I’m here to show you what I sewed up with mine! \n\nI chose the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Grove Digitally Printed Rayon Challis</a>, which is a gorgeous medium-scale floral print in dreamy blues, purples and greens. When I opened my fabric after it came in the mail, I was like, “Whaaaaat?!” and let me tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, the print is even prettier in person; the colors are lovely and the design has an almost watercolored, painterly quality that I really love. But the main reason for the “Whaaaaat?!” was the texture of the fabric. It was…crispy? Crunchy? Anyway, whatever it was, it didn’t feel like any rayon challis I’ve ever used before. Much heavier and not drapey at all. I was a bit skeptical at first, but this turned out to be part of the magic of this fabric.\n \nAs stated on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> in the description of this fabric, it’s really important to pre-wash your digitally printed rayon. In order to print the beautiful designs on the fabric, it has to be specially treated. This is why it feels all crispy crunchy. I threw mine in the washer, washed on cold, and I dried mine on medium for about 20 minutes.\n\nNOTE: It’s recommended on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> that you lay flat to dry. I decided to dry mine in the drier a wee bit to prevent future accidental shrinkages (ask me how I know about this), but lots of sewing people have lots of opinions about this. Do what your heart tells you. But I wouldn’t recommend drying it on high heat. \n\nAnyway, once I took it out of the drier, it was like magic. Suuuper soft, totally lovely, drapey, perfect rayon challis. I even twirled it around all dramatic like and heard that lovely swoosh sound that rayon has and it was music to my ears. You know what I’m talking about, all you fellow rayon lovers out there. \n\nIt was time to cut into this bad boy, and I had the perfect pattern in mind. A few weeks ago, I made a <a href=\"https://sewhouse7.com/products/the-tea-house-top-and-dress\" target=\"_blank\">Tea House Dress, pattern by Sew House 7</a>. It’s this lovely vintage-style dress that is SOOOOO comfortable and pretty and wearable and just everything a dress ought to be. You can check out the first one I made over at <a href=\"http://www.thelatesew.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Late Sew</a>. I wore my first one three times in one week, so I knew I needed another, and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Grove Rayon Challis</a> seemed like the perfect fabric for this pattern. \n\nI cut my pattern pieces and got to sewing. This rayon sews up like most rayon I’m familiar with. It’s light weight, and can be shifty, so be extra careful when cutting and sewing. Cut carefully and use pattern weights (or, you know, random heavy objects you have lying around). If you are lazy with the pins like I am, maybe up your pin game a little? If you’ve ever sewn with rayon before, you’ll be just fine. If you haven’t, don’t be afraid! The heavenliness that is wearing rayon challis is worth the extra effort. So soft! \n\nMy new Tea House Dress in the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Grove </a> print is SO good you guys. It’s drapey and flowy and pretty AND I can just throw it on and look like I tried to look nice, when actually, I didn’t have to try that hard. It ties at the waist so it’s flattering, but it’s loose and comfy so you don’t have to worry about how many donuts you may or may not have eaten recently. And the pockets, darlings. All dresses should have pockets, don’t you agree? \n\nSo here I am modeling my Garden Grove Tea Dress in my garden. Actually it’s just my backyard. I don’t really garden, because I’m too busy sewing, but let’s pretend I have a pretty garden in which I can traipse about, swooshing my rayon dress around like a tea party princess. \n\nGet your digitally printed rayon challis from fabric.com, WASH it to see the magic unfold, and sew up some swooshy goodness for yourself. Then tell me all about it, because I love new sewing friends and chatting about sewing adventures. \n\nThanks for letting me hang out with you all on the fabulous fabric.com blog. Happy sewing, loves!\n",

                        "html": "<p>Created by: <a href=\"http://www.thelatesew.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Late Sew</a></p>\n\n<p>Hello lovely fabric.com friends! My name is Vienna and I have a little blog called The Late Sew (I only sew late at night, because motherhood), and I’m so excited to be here today talking about this amazing new digitally printed rayon challis. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric.com</a> has several brand new beautiful prints to choose from and I’m here to show you what I sewed up with mine! </p>\n\n<p>I chose the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Garden Grove Digitally Printed Rayon Challis</a>, which is a gorgeous medium-scale floral print in dreamy blues, purples and greens. When I opened my fabric after it came in the mail, I was like, “Whaaaaat?!” and let me tell you why.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the print is even prettier in person; the colors are lovely and the design has an almost watercolored, painterly quality that I really love. But the main reason for the “Whaaaaat?!” was the texture of the fabric. It was…crispy? Crunchy? Anyway, whatever it was, it didn’t feel like any rayon challis I’ve ever used before. Much heavier and not drapey at all. I was a bit skeptical at first, but this turned out to be part of the magic of this fabric.</p>\n\n<p>As stated on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> in the description of this fabric, it’s really important to pre-wash your digitally printed rayon. In order to print the beautiful designs on the fabric, it has to be specially treated. This is why it feels all crispy crunchy. I threw mine in the washer, washed on cold, and I dried mine on medium for about 20 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: It’s recommended on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0541029/garden-grove-digitally-printed-rayon-challis\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> that you lay flat to dry. I decided to dry mine in the drier a wee bit to prevent future accidental shrinkages (ask me how I know about this), but lots of sewing people have lots of opinions about this. Do what your heart tells you. But I wouldn’t recommend drying it on high heat. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, once I took it out of the drier, it was like magic. Suuuper soft, totally lovely, drapey, perfect rayon challis. I even twirled it around all dramatic like and heard that lovely swoosh sound that rayon has and it was music to my ears. You know what I’m talking about, all you fellow rayon lovers out there. </p>\n\n<p>It was time to cut into this bad boy, and I had the perfect pattern in mind. A few weeks ago, I made a <a href=\"https://sewhouse7.com/products/the-tea-house-top-and-dress\" target=\"_blank\">Tea House Dress, pattern by Sew House 7</a>.

Using this Strip & Slash technique not only helps you build blocks faster, it also reduces cutting time and the amount of raw-edged pieces you'll need to manage during the piecing process.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Block Party Mod Tartan](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Block%20Party%3A%20Mod%20Tartan/block%20pics_13-min.jpg)\n</p>  \n\nRather than making a single block at a time, you will be building all the blocks required simultaneously.

If you have never tried sewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a>, or past attempts have left you stumped, these tips and tricks will have you mastering projects like a pro. First, I’ll share with you some of the most helpful tips I have learned and then we will create the perfect shower gift together.\n\n####Prewash Your Cotton\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> does not shrink, so if you are pairing it with cotton (like in this tutorial), make sure to pre-wash the cotton first.\n\n####Heat and Washing\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is heat sensitive and embossed patterns can be ruined if it comes in contact with an iron. You shouldn’t need to iron your minky at all, but since we are pairing it with a cotton we will iron that before we put them together. Keep in mind your heat settings when your drying the finished blanket. Tumble on low heat, or if possible - hang to dry. Avoid using fabric softeners, as they can leave a greasy film and clump the fibers.\n\n####Leave Excess Minky Around All Edges\nIf your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> has wavy selvage (especially on the Dimple Dot), don’t try to sew over the top- cut those off! Since <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> has the tendency to stretch slightly, I have found if you leave yourself extra <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> around all your edges you’ll have a little extra in case you have any pulling. Just 1/2 - 1 inch is all you need. We will trim the excess off later. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/Selvage-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Vacuum Your Edges\nVacuum the edges of your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> right after cutting, especially the faux fur. It becomes airborne and messy really easy, so vacuuming the edges with the wand makes quick clean-up. It also prevents the fibers from getting stuck in your machine. If you’re sewing near outdoors, you could also take it outside and shake it out or use a lint roller.\n\n####Minky on the Bottom\nWhen you are getting ready to pin, always have your cotton on top. You will have less stretching, and since you cut your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> larger than your cotton you’ll be able to see where you’re sewing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/pinnedblanketpanel-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Pin Like Crazy\nUse lots of pins! Seems excessive, but spacing them every 1-2” keeps everything in place and prevents some of the stretching. \n\n####Stat Sewing on the Length Side of the Minky\nBegin sewing on the length side of your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> (the side you cut the selvage off). <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> tends to be less stretchy lengthwise and more widthwise. If you’ve forgotten, slightly pull your edges and you will feel the difference. \n\n####Wide Seam Allowance\nFor this project, I recommend using 1/2” seam allowance. Don’t forget your locking stitches.\n\n####Control Your Fabric\nI am constantly working my left hand, under the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> and then over the cotton, wherever I feel like the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is moving or needs help staying in place. My right hand is holding the project in place from pin to pin as I sew.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/controlfabric-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Sewing Minky to Minky & Walking Foot\nThere is only one way to do this! Invest in a walking, or even feed foot. With all my <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> experience, I thought I would be able to sew a double sided minky blanket. It was a nightmare, and did not turn out. The first time sewing with a walking foot, was magical. No stretching. At all. Your bottom feed dogs are guiding the bottom <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> anyway, but with a walking foot, the top <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is also being fed through the presser foot, feeding both materials at the same rate. If you plan on sewing a lot of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> projects, you will thank yourself for this purchase. I now sew all of my minky projects with this foot.\n\n####Use a Stretch Needle and Longer Stitch Length\nReplace your standard sewing machine needle with a New stretch sewing machine needle- ideally use a size 90/14. Sew using at lease a 3mm stitch length. As <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is a knit, this will help provide a professional sewing results.\n\n\n####Clean Your Machine\nRegular cleaning of your machine is a good idea anyway, but when you are sewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> you will find more fuzz than usual. Open your bobbin compartment and brush or vacuum out any buildup. \n\n####DIY Baby Shower Gift with Minky\nNow that you have all the tips and tricks needed to start your next project with Minky, let's create a baby blanket and burp cloth set that will be perfect as a shower gift!  I made a version for a boy and girl to give you inspiration for both.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/ConfettiPic-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Materials Needed:\n* 1 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Cuddle®  Minky</a> (for the boy blanket I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0487981/shannon-minky-luxe-cuddle-mountain-fox-pewter-beige\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Minky Luxe Cuddle®  Mountain Fox Pewter</a> and for the girl blanket I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0487999/shannon-minky-luxe-cuddle-hide-ice-pink\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Minky Luxe Cuddle®  Hide Ice Pink</a>. I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/aw-092/shannon-minky-cuddle-dimple-ivory\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Minky Cuddle® Dimple Ivory</a> for the burp cloths, but you could make them from the 1 yard \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> you purchase for your blanket\n* 1 yard quilting cotton  (For the boy blanket I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476769/dear-stella-adventure-awaits-animals-white\" target=\"_blank\">Dear Stella Adventure Awaits Animals White</a> and for the girl blanket I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0478751/art-gallery-letters-xoxoxo\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Letters Xoxoxo</a>.

Lay your cotton blanket panel on your minky right sides together making sure your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> hangs out around all edges. In case you have any stretching, leaving yourself a little extra <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is always better than cutting too short. Cut the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> about 1” away from the edge of your cotton. Vacuum those edges too. You can do the same with your burp cloth panels now. \n\n\nPin in place. Place pins about 1-2” apart. Now, you’re ready to sew!\n\n\n####Start Sewing\nOn the length side of you project and with about 1/2” seam allowance add your first locking stitch. No need to rush, sew slow and steady all the way around. Leave about a 6” opening for your blanket, and about 4” for your burp cloths.\n\n\n####Trim edges\nTrim off any excess minky and notch your corners so they aren’t bulky when you turn your projects inside out. Make sure to pull your corners out so they look nice and sharp.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/Notches-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Topstitch\nChoose a coordinating thread and topstitch your blanket and burp cloths. How amazing do these look?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Sewing With Minky](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/Finished-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow you can choose a lovely ribbon to finish your gift! \n\n\n",

If you have never tried sewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a>, or past attempts have left you stumped, these tips and tricks will have you mastering projects like a pro. First, I’ll share with you some of the most helpful tips I have learned and then we will create the perfect shower gift together.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"prewashyourcotton\">Prewash Your Cotton</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> does not shrink, so if you are pairing it with cotton (like in this tutorial), make sure to pre-wash the cotton first.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"heatandwashing\">Heat and Washing</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is heat sensitive and embossed patterns can be ruined if it comes in contact with an iron. You shouldn’t need to iron your minky at all, but since we are pairing it with a cotton we will iron that before we put them together. Keep in mind your heat settings when your drying the finished blanket. Tumble on low heat, or if possible - hang to dry. Avoid using fabric softeners, as they can leave a greasy film and clump the fibers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"leaveexcessminkyaroundalledges\">Leave Excess Minky Around All Edges</h4>\n\n<p>If your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> has wavy selvage (especially on the Dimple Dot), don’t try to sew over the top- cut those off! Since <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> has the tendency to stretch slightly, I have found if you leave yourself extra <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> around all your edges you’ll have a little extra in case you have any pulling. Just 1/2 - 1 inch is all you need. We will trim the excess off later. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/Selvage-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips for Sewing With Minky\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"vacuumyouredges\">Vacuum Your Edges</h4>\n\n<p>Vacuum the edges of your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> right after cutting, especially the faux fur. It becomes airborne and messy really easy, so vacuuming the edges with the wand makes quick clean-up. It also prevents the fibers from getting stuck in your machine. If you’re sewing near outdoors, you could also take it outside and shake it out or use a lint roller.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"minkyonthebottom\">Minky on the Bottom</h4>\n\n<p>When you are getting ready to pin, always have your cotton on top. You will have less stretching, and since you cut your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> larger than your cotton you’ll be able to see where you’re sewing.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/pinnedblanketpanel-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips for Sewing With Minky\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pinlikecrazy\">Pin Like Crazy</h4>\n\n<p>Use lots of pins! Seems excessive, but spacing them every 1-2” keeps everything in place and prevents some of the stretching. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"statsewingonthelengthsideoftheminky\">Stat Sewing on the Length Side of the Minky</h4>\n\n<p>Begin sewing on the length side of your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> (the side you cut the selvage off). <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> tends to be less stretchy lengthwise and more widthwise. If you’ve forgotten, slightly pull your edges and you will feel the difference. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"wideseamallowance\">Wide Seam Allowance</h4>\n\n<p>For this project, I recommend using 1/2” seam allowance. Don’t forget your locking stitches.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"controlyourfabric\">Control Your Fabric</h4>\n\n<p>I am constantly working my left hand, under the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> and then over the cotton, wherever I feel like the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is moving or needs help staying in place. My right hand is holding the project in place from pin to pin as I sew.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/controlfabric-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips for Sewing With Minky\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewingminkytominkywalkingfoot\">Sewing Minky to Minky &amp; Walking Foot</h4>\n\n<p>There is only one way to do this! Invest in a walking, or even feed foot. With all my <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> experience, I thought I would be able to sew a double sided minky blanket. It was a nightmare, and did not turn out. The first time sewing with a walking foot, was magical. No stretching. At all. Your bottom feed dogs are guiding the bottom <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> anyway, but with a walking foot, the top <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is also being fed through the presser foot, feeding both materials at the same rate. If you plan on sewing a lot of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> projects, you will thank yourself for this purchase. I now sew all of my minky projects with this foot.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"useastretchneedleandlongerstitchlength\">Use a Stretch Needle and Longer Stitch Length</h4>\n\n<p>Replace your standard sewing machine needle with a New stretch sewing machine needle- ideally use a size 90/14. Sew using at lease a 3mm stitch length. As <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is a knit, this will help provide a professional sewing results.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cleanyourmachine\">Clean Your Machine</h4>\n\n<p>Regular cleaning of your machine is a good idea anyway, but when you are sewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> you will find more fuzz than usual. Open your bobbin compartment and brush or vacuum out any buildup. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"diybabyshowergiftwithminky\">DIY Baby Shower Gift with Minky</h4>\n\n<p>Now that you have all the tips and tricks needed to start your next project with Minky, let's create a baby blanket and burp cloth set that will be perfect as a shower gift!

Lay your cotton blanket panel on your minky right sides together making sure your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> hangs out around all edges. In case you have any stretching, leaving yourself a little extra <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> is always better than cutting too short. Cut the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=minky\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> about 1” away from the edge of your cotton. Vacuum those edges too. You can do the same with your burp cloth panels now. </p>\n\n<p>Pin in place. Place pins about 1-2” apart. Now, you’re ready to sew!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"startsewing\">Start Sewing</h4>\n\n<p>On the length side of you project and with about 1/2” seam allowance add your first locking stitch. No need to rush, sew slow and steady all the way around. Leave about a 6” opening for your blanket, and about 4” for your burp cloths.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"trimedges\">Trim edges</h4>\n\n<p>Trim off any excess minky and notch your corners so they aren’t bulky when you turn your projects inside out. Make sure to pull your corners out so they look nice and sharp.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20with%20Minky/Notches-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tips for Sewing With Minky\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"topstitch\">Topstitch</h4>\n\n<p>Choose a coordinating thread and topstitch your blanket and burp cloths.

From 90s grunge fans who rocked the look as part of an overall edgy, rocker vibe to the outdoorsy crowd who preferred the casual, easy-to-wear style (and ability to keep them warm) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> was a fashion staple that seemed posed to be around for the long haul.\n\nBut as the years went on and trends changed <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> fabric took a back seat to other more prominent fashions. But, as most of us know, what goes around comes around and this staple of the 90s fashion scene is making a comeback in a big way! Gone are the days of sticking with the simple <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirt. Instead, new designs from flannel pants to skirts and dresses are becoming just as popular as the humble <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirt, making it the perfect fabric for those who love DIYing their own personal fashions.\n\n####Why Wear Flannel Fabric?\nIf you’re either too young to have appreciated <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> in the 90s, or simply never jumped on the flannel bandwagon, we’re here to let you know you’ve been missing out! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">Flannel</a> fabric goes through a special mechanical process that raises the fibers of the cloth, making it soft and warm to wear. It’s durable enough to withstand even vigorous activity (like a hike on a chilly fall day) and is typically associated with a relaxed fit that allows for unrestricted movement and flatters pretty much any body type. \nPlus, it’s an easy to sew fabric that’s stable, versatile and relatively inexpensive. \n\n#####Here are some of our favorites this season:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/flannel_shirt_fabrics.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0516821/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-buffalo-check-medium-white\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Buffalo Check Medium White</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0404858/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-plaid-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Plaid Blue</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0344808/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-plaid-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Plaid Adventure</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0442489/yarn-dyed-flannel-check-red-black\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Flannel Check Red Black</a>\n\n\n####The Flannel Shirt: Always in Style\nLike we mentioned before, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirts have been popular for decades. With long sleeves and buttons up the front they’re perfect for throwing on to keep warm without needing a heavy coat. Or you can pair them with a variety of outfits. Dress them up with jeans and high heeled boots for a night out or dress it down with leggings and sneakers for some lounging time at home. \n\nIf you’re going to start with a shirt you can’t go wrong with classic red <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> like this popular fabric. It works well for men and women (and would make a great homemade gift!). But modern flannel isn’t limited to the tradition designs of the grunge era. Choose a fun and unexpected print to take your flannel shirt in a whole new direction that combines the traditional fabric with modern design elements for a perfectly funky look.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-paper/\" target=\"_blank\">this great shirt pattern from Grainline Studio</a>.\n\n####DIY Tie Front Flannel Shirt Dress\nInspired from a 2017 designer dress, the R13 tie-waist <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> dress retails for a few hundred dollars, but you can create this look for under $40 with a basic men’s shirt pattern and some <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20close%20up-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Supplies:\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0442489/yarn-dyed-flannel-check-red-black\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Red/Black Check Flannel Fabric – 2.5 yards</a> (45\" wide flannel-4 yds)\n* <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OA7FL4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">McCall’s Men’s Shirt Pattern M6044</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G9X337E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">Shirt Buttons</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0343324/pellon-815-red-dot-tracing-material\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern Paper</a> or Tissue Paper\n\nThis look requires a loose-fit, so we chose a Men’s shirt pattern in order to obtain that look with minimal pattern alterations. In the designer dress, there’s traditional elements in the collar and sleeve cuffs, and no back yoke, so this pattern satisfied those needs.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20side%20view-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n\n####Altering the Pattern:\nUse tissue paper or pattern paper to lengthen the shirt pattern where it’s marked. I extended it 8” for a knee length dress. I marked where the tie-waist sleeves would be attached.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/8%20inch%20lengthen%20pattern-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Pattern%20Sleeve%20attach%20points-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nThe sleeves will become the waist tie- so I extended the sleeve shoulders to create a straight line so they could easily be incorporated into the side seams. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Sleeve%20patterns-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20sleeve%20pieces-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFor the cap sleeve look, I added paper to extend the shoulders, and marked where the sleeve opening would be. I measured my bust and altered the pattern for a proper fit. I also compared the design to the pattern and reduced the underarms to obtain a straight, loose fit. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/pattern%20cap%20sleeves-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Pattern%20side%20by%20side-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce my pattern alterations were complete, I followed the pattern as directed, but I did skip the interfacing for a more casual look.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20laid%20out-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tie Front Flannel Dress](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20laid%20out%20with%20waist%20tie%20showing-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nWith flannel your options are pretty much limitless.

                        "html": "<p>We’re not sure there’s a more well-known look than the quintessential red and black <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirt. From 90s grunge fans who rocked the look as part of an overall edgy, rocker vibe to the outdoorsy crowd who preferred the casual, easy-to-wear style (and ability to keep them warm) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> was a fashion staple that seemed posed to be around for the long haul.</p>\n\n<p>But as the years went on and trends changed <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> fabric took a back seat to other more prominent fashions. But, as most of us know, what goes around comes around and this staple of the 90s fashion scene is making a comeback in a big way! Gone are the days of sticking with the simple <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirt. Instead, new designs from flannel pants to skirts and dresses are becoming just as popular as the humble <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirt, making it the perfect fabric for those who love DIYing their own personal fashions.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whywearflannelfabric\">Why Wear Flannel Fabric?</h4>\n\n<p>If you’re either too young to have appreciated <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> in the 90s, or simply never jumped on the flannel bandwagon, we’re here to let you know you’ve been missing out! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">Flannel</a> fabric goes through a special mechanical process that raises the fibers of the cloth, making it soft and warm to wear. It’s durable enough to withstand even vigorous activity (like a hike on a chilly fall day) and is typically associated with a relaxed fit that allows for unrestricted movement and flatters pretty much any body type. <br />\nPlus, it’s an easy to sew fabric that’s stable, versatile and relatively inexpensive. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"herearesomeofourfavoritesthisseason\">Here are some of our favorites this season:</h5>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/flannel_shirt_fabrics.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0516821/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-buffalo-check-medium-white\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Buffalo Check Medium White</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0404858/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-plaid-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Plaid Blue</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0344808/kaufman-mammoth-flannel-plaid-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Mammoth Flannel Plaid Adventure</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0442489/yarn-dyed-flannel-check-red-black\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Flannel Check Red Black</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"theflannelshirtalwaysinstyle\">The Flannel Shirt: Always in Style</h4>\n\n<p>Like we mentioned before, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> shirts have been popular for decades. With long sleeves and buttons up the front they’re perfect for throwing on to keep warm without needing a heavy coat. Or you can pair them with a variety of outfits. Dress them up with jeans and high heeled boots for a night out or dress it down with leggings and sneakers for some lounging time at home. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re going to start with a shirt you can’t go wrong with classic red <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> like this popular fabric. It works well for men and women (and would make a great homemade gift!). But modern flannel isn’t limited to the tradition designs of the grunge era. Choose a fun and unexpected print to take your flannel shirt in a whole new direction that combines the traditional fabric with modern design elements for a perfectly funky look.</p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://grainlinestudio.com/shop/women/archer-button-up-shirt-paper/\" target=\"_blank\">this great shirt pattern from Grainline Studio</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"diytiefrontflannelshirtdress\">DIY Tie Front Flannel Shirt Dress</h4>\n\n<p>Inspired from a 2017 designer dress, the R13 tie-waist <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> dress retails for a few hundred dollars, but you can create this look for under $40 with a basic men’s shirt pattern and some <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=flannel\" target=\"_blank\">flannel</a> fabric.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20close%20up-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"supplies\">Supplies:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0442489/yarn-dyed-flannel-check-red-black\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Red/Black Check Flannel Fabric – 2.5 yards</a> (45\" wide flannel-4 yds)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OA7FL4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">McCall’s Men’s Shirt Pattern M6044</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G9X337E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">Shirt Buttons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0343324/pellon-815-red-dot-tracing-material\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern Paper</a> or Tissue Paper</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This look requires a loose-fit, so we chose a Men’s shirt pattern in order to obtain that look with minimal pattern alterations. In the designer dress, there’s traditional elements in the collar and sleeve cuffs, and no back yoke, so this pattern satisfied those needs.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20side%20view-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"alteringthepattern\">Altering the Pattern:</h4>\n\n<p>Use tissue paper or pattern paper to lengthen the shirt pattern where it’s marked. I extended it 8” for a knee length dress. I marked where the tie-waist sleeves would be attached.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/8%20inch%20lengthen%20pattern-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Pattern%20Sleeve%20attach%20points-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The sleeves will become the waist tie- so I extended the sleeve shoulders to create a straight line so they could easily be incorporated into the side seams. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Sleeve%20patterns-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20sleeve%20pieces-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For the cap sleeve look, I added paper to extend the shoulders, and marked where the sleeve opening would be. I measured my bust and altered the pattern for a proper fit. I also compared the design to the pattern and reduced the underarms to obtain a straight, loose fit. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/pattern%20cap%20sleeves-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Pattern%20side%20by%20side-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Once my pattern alterations were complete, I followed the pattern as directed, but I did skip the interfacing for a more casual look.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20laid%20out-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tie%20Front%20Flannel%20Shirt%20Dress/Flannel%20dress%20laid%20out%20with%20waist%20tie%20showing-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tie Front Flannel Dress\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>With flannel your options are pretty much limitless.

I was so thrilled to be given the opportunity to blog for fabric.com for Halloween!  \n\nMy youngest son has been begging me for a bird costume and I had been brainstorming ideas.  My first thought was that it would get way more wear if I could think of a way to make it something he could put on all by himself.   At the age of 4, independence is a huge factor in how often something gets played with or worn in our house.  The <a href=\"https://littlelizardking.com/girls/yoggers\" target=\"_blank\">Little Lizard King Yogger pattern</a> was the perfect choice for the pants and I used the <a href=\"https://littlelizardking.com/girls/ravenna\" target=\"_blank\">Ravenna raglan pattern</a> for the top.  Once I settled on my patterns, I was excited to get started!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/DSC_19472046-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Fabric Choices\nFor this bird costume you'll need knit fabrics in a variety of bold, bright colors.  I used the following knits for my costume, and the colors were amazing:\n\n* 3 yds. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/et-382/kaufman-laguna-stretch-jersey-knit-royal\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Laguna Stretch Jersey Knit Royal</a>  (this is the main fabric)\n* 1/2 yds. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/et-529/kaufman-laguna-stretch-jersey-knit-orange\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Laguna Stretch Jersey Knit Orange</a> (bird legs)\n* 1/4 yd. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0516334/kaufman-dana-jersey-knit-48-oz-clover\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Dana Jersey Knit Fern Clover</a>\n* 1/4 yd. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0404498/kaufman-catalina-interlock-knit-red\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Catalina Interlock Knit Red </a>\n* 1/4 yd. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0516337/kaufman-dana-jersey-knit-48-oz-yellow\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Dana Jersey Knit 4.8oz Yellow</a>\n* 1/4 yd. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0362223/telio-stretch-bamboo-rayon-jersey-knit-sky-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Stretch Bamboo Rayon Jersey Knit Sky Blue</a>\n\n####Costume Patterns\nTwo of Little Lizard Kings popular patterns, the Yogger and Ravenna patterns, pair perfectly to create this costume!\n\n* <a href=\"https://littlelizardking.com/girls/yoggers\" target=\"_blank\">Little Lizard King Yogger pattern</a>\n* <a href=\"https://littlelizardking.com/girls/ravenna\" target=\"_blank\">Little Lizard King Ravenna pattern</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/DSC_19562046-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Preparing the Pants/Yoggers\nThe pants were extremely easy!  I simply followed the step by step instructions provided in the <a href=\"https://littlelizardking.com/girls/yoggers\" target=\"_blank\">Little Lizard King Yogger pattern</a>.  I chose the full length pants option and simply created the look of bird legs by manipulating the color placement.  \n\nTo create the look of skinny bird legs, I used the orange colored knit for the bottom most fitted part of the yoggers.  I used the royal blue colored knit for the top, bubble part of the yoggers, to mimic the wider thigh of a bird leg.  The yoga style waistband made the pants super easy for my son to slide on and off without assistance.  \n\n####Pattern Adjustments\nBecause the Ravenna Raglan top was designed for girls, I sized up 2 sizes for my son so it would have a looser fit. I also omitted the waistband and wristbands and just extended the pattern pieces 3 to 4 inches longer so they could be hemmed normally. \n\n####Preparing the Wings\nThis is the part of the tutorial where I kind of winged it……pun intended.  But I will walk you through the construction step by step.  \n\nFirst, I laid out my front shirt piece and one sleeve.  I placed the sleeve at an angle because I wanted to cut the wing in way that would allow him to raise his arms without the shirt pulling up.  I measured the length of the sleeve and the length of the shirt from the armpit down.  I then cut my wing flaps (as mirror images) 1.5 inches shorter than both of those measurements and rounded it down.  This is also where I said that I winged it.  The angle of the wing flap and sleeve do not have to be identical and there is no exact way to round the wing flaps.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/Tutorial%20Pic%201-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou are now ready to add the feathers.  My feathers were about 4 inches long by 3 inches wide, but this is personal preference.  I stacked up a few of my knits and cut several at a time.  When I added the feathers to the wings I started at the very bottom and worked my way up.  Once I had a row in place, I would sew across the entire row to attach them all at once.  Use a matching bobbin thread color so the thread is not noticeable on the back side of the wing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%202-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nContinue adding rows of feathers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%203-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nWhen you reach the upper part of the wing, start angling the feathers slightly.  By the top row, the straight raw edge of each feather should be flush with the raw edge of the wing. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%204-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou will now enclose the top raw edge of the wing in binding.  Cut a strip of knit 1.5” by a measurement that is half inch longer than the top wing width.  Flip the wing, wrong side up.  Place the strip of knit across the back of the wing, lining up the top raw edge of the wing with the long raw edge of the knit binding.  Sew to attach.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%205-min.jpg)\n</p>\nFlip the wing right side up and trim the seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%206-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the bias up.  Tuck the short raw end in towards the wing.  Fold the top raw edge of the bias to the seam and then fold it down again to enclose the top raw edge of the wing.   Sew to attach.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%207-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYour finished wing will look like this.  Give the feathers a good steam press and baste them down the straight side of each wing (if desired).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%208-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Finishing the Top\nCut an oval for the center of the shirt.  For easier application, back the oval with wonder under and then apply it and topstitch it to the shirt front.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%209-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSew the raglan shirt front, shirt back and sleeves together as directed in the pattern.  They will now make a continuous loop.\n\nPlace a wing on the shirt front, right sides together.  The top wing binding should begin directly under the underarm seam.  The straight raw edge of the wing will be lined up with the straight raw edge of the shirt.  Baste in place.  Repeat with other wing.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%2010-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFold the back of the shirt over onto the front of the shirt.  Line up the sleeve, underarm seam and side raw edges.  Sew to attach using a stretch stitch.  Repeat on other side. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/tutorial%20pic%2011-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the shirt right side out.  Following the directions in the pattern add the neck band to finish the neckline. Hem the sleeves and bottom of the shirt 1/2\".  \n\nThe only step left is to tack the wing bias to the sleeve seam of the shirt so it looks like one piece.  I tacked the wing about every 1.5 to 2 inches with a quick hand stitch. \n\n\n####The Hat\nThe bird hat is something I quickly drafted for my son.  I extended the center piece of the bonnet to a little peak to create the look of a bird.  I also sewed three pairs of feathers, right sides together, with interfacing sandwiched in between.   The interfacing helped them stand up nicely.  I basted the bottom of the feathers together to make them easier to work with and to keep them positioned the way I wanted them.  I then cut a small slit in the top of the hat and inserted the feathers.  To secure them I sewed across the opening and the base of the feathers from the underside of the hat!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bird Costume](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/DSC_19162046-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThat's it- you're done!  I hope your little trick or tweeter has a great Halloween and loves their costume.  This costume idea could easily be modified to be a bat or a butterfly!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is Sarah from <a href=\"http://bluesusanmakes.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Susan Makes</a>. We have a little hooded bat cape that I made years ago that has lived through the toddler life of 3 little boys. Now that our 4th boy is hitting the dress-up stage I thought it would be fun to remake this cape and teach you how to make one too. With Halloween right around the corner you can sew it up to add to a set of Batman pajamas and your costume is ready to go!\n\nFor this project you’ll need a sturdy <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?colorfamily=black&fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">black knit</a> that won’t fray and has a little body to it. A knit with 4 way stretch is ideal but not necessary. I chose to use this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0337432/polyester-spandex-lame-jersey-knit-matte-black\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester Spandex Matte Lame Jersey</a>. It has a sheen to it on one side that makes it look a little like a soft vinyl but it’s stretchy and has great drape. I love it!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2025.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis pattern is sized to fit about 3-4T. The cape length is about 38’’ from the nape of the neck to the pointed bottom. In this tutorial you will be making 2 hoods. One will be the outer hood and one will be used as the lining. I’ll show you how to put the hoods together and sew them to the single layer cape. We will hem the sides of the cape and stitch on a Velcro closure. The bottom of the cape will remain unhemmed. Let’s get started!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2024.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Supplies Needed\n* 1 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?colorfamily=black&fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">black knit</a> fabric (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0337432/polyester-spandex-lame-jersey-knit-matte-black\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester Spandex Matte Lame Jersey</a>)\n* 1 square 5/8'' black, sew in, hook and loop tape, velcro\n* “Stretch” sewing machine needle\n* Printed copy of the <a href=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/DIY%20Hooded%20Bat%20Cape.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Hooded Bat Cape Pattern</a>\n\n####Cutting and Pattern Prep Tips\n* Print pattern pages and tape them together into a grid as instructed on the PDF file. To assemble the grid, cut one short side and one long side off of each page to make it easier to tape together. Cut out pattern pieces.\n* Fold your fabric in half to quickly cut out the pieces 2 at a time. Lay all your pieces out on the fabric before you begin cutting.\n* Use pattern weights to hold the patterns in place while cutting. Table knives from your kitchen work great in a pinch.\n* Pay attention to the stretch lines on the fabric and place those lines parallel to the direction the fabric stretches the most\n* Use washable chalk (test on a fabric scrap) or washi tape to mark the placement of the bat ears on one Right Hood Side Panel and one Left Hood Side Panel. These panels will be used for the Outer Hood. \n* The perfectionist in me didn’t want to attempt cutting out the points on the cape with the paper floating around so I used a white chalk marker to draw around them before cutting. Just cut off the white as you cut since these points will not be hemmed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2023.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Cutting Instructions:\n* Cut 4 pieces from the Hood Side Panel pattern (2 Right Side Hoods, 2 Left Side Hoods)\n* Cut 2 pieces from the Hood Center Panel pattern\n* Cut 1 piece on the fold from the Cape pattern\n* Cut 4 pieces from the Bat Ear pattern\n\n\n####Sewing Instructions\n*All seams are sewn with a 1/2‘’ seam allowance unless otherwise specified.\n\n####Make the Outer Hood and Hood Lining\nUsing the Outer Hood Side Panels (marked for the ears) begin to construct the Outer Hood. With right sides together pin a Right Hood Side Panel to a Hood Center Panel. Sew the 2 panels together with a 1/2‘’ seam allowance.The matte finish on this fabric showed every pin mark so I decided to keep all the pins within the seam allowance. I pointed the pins in the direction of my sew starting point so that they were easy to remove as I sewed. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%201-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith right sides together, pin a Left Side Panel to the other side of the Center Panel. Sew them together and press seams open with a warm iron. Set this Outer Hood aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRepeat the first two steps to make the Hood Lining using the remaining 2 Side Panels and Center Panel.  Press all seams open.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress the bottom edge of the Hood Lining toward the inside 1/2‘’. This will be topstitched along the pressed fold later to enclose the neck seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%204-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith right sides together, match up the front seams of the Hood Lining and the Outer Hood and pin them together around the face opening.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%205-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew around the face opening. Make sure to unfold the bottom edge of the Hood Lining. Start sewing at that crease and stop sewing at the crease on the opposite side. Backstitch at the beginning and end.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%206-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTrim off the top front corner on each end, close to the stitches and clip into the seam allowance of the curves as shown.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%207-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the Hood right side out and push out the front corners with a dull pencil tip.

It works best to start at the neck of the cape and sew toward the point. It may be tricky to sew along the narrow point but you can make it easier by using a pin to help hold the tip as you feed it through the machine.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%2010-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Attach the Hood to the Cape\nWith right sides together, lay the Outer Hood onto the neck of the Cape. Lift the Hood Lining out of the way and pin the Outer Hood to the neck of the Cape.  Make sure to line up the side hem of the cape with the front corner of the Hood. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2011-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew the Outer Hood to Cape backstitching at the beginning and end of the seam.

Refold the Hood Lining along the crease to enclose all the raw edges. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%2014-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin the pressed fold of the Hood Lining so it lines up with the Outer Hood stitch line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%2015-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTopstitch along the Hood Lining about 1/8’’ away from the folded edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%2016%20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew a small square of hook and loop tape to the corner points of the Hood.

Starting in the middle of the base (smallest side) of the triangle, sew around all three sides leaving a 1 1/2 ‘’ gap for turning. Trim off the corner points as shown, and turn the Bat Ear right side out. Use a dull pencil to push out the corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hooded Bat Cape](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/photo%2018-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTuck the seam allowance into the opening and press the ear flat.

This is Sarah from <a href=\"http://bluesusanmakes.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Susan Makes</a>. We have a little hooded bat cape that I made years ago that has lived through the toddler life of 3 little boys. Now that our 4th boy is hitting the dress-up stage I thought it would be fun to remake this cape and teach you how to make one too. With Halloween right around the corner you can sew it up to add to a set of Batman pajamas and your costume is ready to go!</p>\n\n<p>For this project you’ll need a sturdy <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?colorfamily=black&amp;fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">black knit</a> that won’t fray and has a little body to it. A knit with 4 way stretch is ideal but not necessary. I chose to use this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0337432/polyester-spandex-lame-jersey-knit-matte-black\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester Spandex Matte Lame Jersey</a>. It has a sheen to it on one side that makes it look a little like a soft vinyl but it’s stretchy and has great drape. I love it!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2025.jpg\" alt=\"Hooded Bat Cape\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This pattern is sized to fit about 3-4T. The cape length is about 38’’ from the nape of the neck to the pointed bottom. In this tutorial you will be making 2 hoods. One will be the outer hood and one will be used as the lining. I’ll show you how to put the hoods together and sew them to the single layer cape. We will hem the sides of the cape and stitch on a Velcro closure. The bottom of the cape will remain unhemmed. Let’s get started!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2024.jpg\" alt=\"Hooded Bat Cape\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"suppliesneeded\">Supplies Needed</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?colorfamily=black&amp;fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">black knit</a> fabric (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0337432/polyester-spandex-lame-jersey-knit-matte-black\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester Spandex Matte Lame Jersey</a>)</li>\n<li>1 square 5/8'' black, sew in, hook and loop tape, velcro</li>\n<li>“Stretch” sewing machine needle</li>\n<li>Printed copy of the <a href=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bird%20Costume/DIY%20Hooded%20Bat%20Cape.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Hooded Bat Cape Pattern</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"cuttingandpatternpreptips\">Cutting and Pattern Prep Tips</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Print pattern pages and tape them together into a grid as instructed on the PDF file. To assemble the grid, cut one short side and one long side off of each page to make it easier to tape together. Cut out pattern pieces.</li>\n<li>Fold your fabric in half to quickly cut out the pieces 2 at a time. Lay all your pieces out on the fabric before you begin cutting.</li>\n<li>Use pattern weights to hold the patterns in place while cutting. Table knives from your kitchen work great in a pinch.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to the stretch lines on the fabric and place those lines parallel to the direction the fabric stretches the most</li>\n<li>Use washable chalk (test on a fabric scrap) or washi tape to mark the placement of the bat ears on one Right Hood Side Panel and one Left Hood Side Panel. These panels will be used for the Outer Hood. </li>\n<li>The perfectionist in me didn’t want to attempt cutting out the points on the cape with the paper floating around so I used a white chalk marker to draw around them before cutting. Just cut off the white as you cut since these points will not be hemmed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hooded%20Bat%20Cape/Photo%2023.jpg\" alt=\"Hooded Bat Cape\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cuttinginstructions\">Cutting Instructions:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cut 4 pieces from the Hood Side Panel pattern (2 Right Side Hoods, 2 Left Side Hoods)</li>\n<li>Cut 2 pieces from the Hood Center Panel pattern</li>\n<li>Cut 1 piece on the fold from the Cape pattern</li>\n<li>Cut 4 pieces from the Bat Ear pattern</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewinginstructions\">Sewing Instructions</h4>\n\n<p>*All seams are sewn with a 1/2‘’ seam allowance unless otherwise specified.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"maketheouterhoodandhoodlining\">Make the Outer Hood and Hood Lining</h4>\n\n<p>Using the Outer Hood Side Panels (marked for the ears) begin to construct the Outer Hood.

Circle Skirts are super easy to make and oh SO comfortable! My little girls and I love wearing them and the best part is they transition from season to season perfectly! Throw on a pair of boots and a button up in the winter, or a v-neck tee and sandals in the summer, to get all-year wear out of this closet staple! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2483.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce you start making these skirts you won't want to stop!\n \n####Supplies Needed\n* 1-2 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">knit fabric</a> (use the <a href=\"https://byhandlondon.com/pages/circle-skirt-app\" target=\"_blank\">skirt calculator</a> below to determine the exact amount)- we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/art-gallery-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery</a> <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0478828/art-gallery-boho-fusion-jersey-knit-swifting-flora-boho\" target=\"_blank\">Swifting Flora Boho</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0478827/art-gallery-boho-fusion-jersery-knit-aqua-di-rose-boho\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Di Rose Boho</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0450457/art-gallery-observer-jersey-knit-overshot-gold\" target=\"_blank\">Observer OverShot Gold</a>\n* 1 yard of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/e-038/1-white-flat-no-roll-elastic\" target=\"_blank\">1\" Elastic</a>\n* Sewing Machine or Serger\n* Coordinating <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>\n* Iron\n \nI used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/art-gallery-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery</a> knits for this tutorial. They are some of my favorite knits to work with because they have great recovery, thanks to their blend of cotton and spandex. I find that the cotton spandex blend creates a more stable knit fabric which makes it much more beginner-friendly than most knits!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2383-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nBefore choosing a fabric, decide what type of a circle skirt you want. The type of fabric makes all the difference in the way the skirt drapes. If you want a really full skirt with plenty of body, try a scuba knit like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=scuba+knit\" target=\"_blank\">these</a>. If you want a skirt with less volume that's more drapey, try out a lighter weight rayon knit like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=rayon+knit\" target=\"_blank\">these</a>.\n\n####Let's Get Started!\n \nFirst, head over to By Hand London to use their <a href=\"https://byhandlondon.com/pages/circle-skirt-app\" target=\"_blank\">circle skirt calculator</a> . This tool is a huge help and saves you from having to do all the math yourself!  Insert your waist measurement into the calculator. You'll need to choose the full circle skirt and your desired length. When determining the length keep in mind the width of the fabric you will be using. Have the calculator do the math and make a note of your waist radius.\n \nLay your knit fabric out on a large table and fold the fabric in half so the selvage edges are aligned.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2224-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nUsing a ruler and a washable marking pen, trace out your waistline circle using the radius measurement that coordinates with your waist measurement.\n\nI like to slowly drag the ruler along the fabric while I use my other hand to keep the end of the ruler lined up with the edge of the fabric.\n\nOnce the waist is marked, it's time to move on to the hem.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2225-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFirst, you'll need to determine how long you want your skirt to be. The skirt will sit at the smallest part of your waist, so measure from there and add a half inch for the hem.\nAdd the skirt measurement to the radius measurement and mark the next cutting line. I typically use a string or a skinny measuring tape for this step.\n\nCut the hem of the skirt and repeat this process to create the back of the skirt.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2228-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nCut out the waistband length (waist measurement) x height 3\"\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2253-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nLay the skirt front and back on top of each other with right sides together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2245-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2248-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPlace pins along the side seams. Sew with a half inch seam allowance. Don't forget to take your pins out as you sew! You can also use a regular sewing machine for this project, I just prefer to use a serger with knits.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2252-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nWith right sides together sew the short end of the waistband together. Flip it right side out and fold in half so that the wrong sides are on the inside. This will create the casing for the elastic.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2254-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFlip the skirt right side out and divide the waist into 4 equal sections. Mark the middle front and back with a pin. This will help you to accurately line up the waistband and skirt together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2262-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSection the waistband into 4 equal sections and mark with pins. Line up the skirt pins and the waistband pins, stretching the waistband so it's on the outside of the skirt. Sew around the waistband leaving a 2 inch opening to thread the elastic through.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2263-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nCut the elastic the same length as the waist measurement.\n\nAttach a safety pin to the end of the elastic and thread it through the casing.\n\nPull both ends of the elastic out and overlay them on top of each other by 1 inch. WIth a zigzag stitch, sew them together.\n\nPull the elastic back into the casing (try on the skirt to make sure it fits) and stitch the opening closed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2272-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Now it's time to work on the hem!\n\nSet your sewing machine to the longest stitch length and baste along the perimeter of the skirt hem.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2274-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nGently pull on the top thread and ease the fabric so it begins to fold on top of itself. The basting stitch allows the excess fabric to be eased in, which creates a beautifully even hem with no puckers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2275-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nFold the hem up one-half inch and pin in place.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2283-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew 3/8th's of an inch from the bottom of the hem all the way around the skirt.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2281-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nPress the hem and the waistband with a hot iron and plenty of steam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mommy%20and%20Me%20Circle%20Skirts/IMG_2496.jpg)\n</p>\n \n \nIf you enjoyed this tutorial, check out my <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/mommy-me-tote-bags-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">Mommy & Me Tote Bags tutorial</a>!\n\n \n \n\n",

When the nap is found, it’s helpful to mark an arrow on the back of the fur fabric to eliminate directional confusion when cutting out a pattern.\n\nMarking faux fur fabric is easy- since the backing is an extra thick knit, you can trace your pattern with a marker and it will not show through.\n\n####Cutting Faux Fur:\nWhen cutting faux fur, make small snips on the backing knit fabric only and avoid cutting the fur pile. You don’t want to cut the fur pile during cutting, it will result in uneven fur pile visible around the seams. \n\nYou can also use a box cutter with a fresh, sharp blade to cut the fur backing. The razor blade cutting method is faster, but it can also distort the edges of the fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%201%20-%20small%20snips-min.png)\n</p>\n \nExpert Tip: Use strips of packing tape along the cut fur edges to pick up any loose piles. \n\n####Sewing Fur With No Seam Allowance:\nWith right sides together, tuck the fur pile in. Using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0334192/clover-wonder-clips\" target=\"_blank\">Wonder Clips</a> instead of pins – it’s better because the thickness of the fur will distort the fabric when pinned.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%202%20-%20tuck%20and%20wonder%20clips-min.png)\n</p>\n \nExpert Tip: Use a walking foot.\n\nUse a wide zig zag stitch along the edge. Sew slowly and use a lot of control on the fur as you sew. When opened, the seam is secure, minimal and almost invisible on the face of the fur fabric. This seam technique is great for most fur-to-fur projects, and will require pattern modifications to reduce the suggested seam allowance. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%203%20-%20zig%20zag%20stitch-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%204%20-%20no%20seam%20bulk-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mommy and Me Circle Skirts](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%205%20-%20grey%20fur%20overhead-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Sewing Fur With a Seam Allowance:\nIf you need to sew fur with a seam allowance, use a walking foot and a straight stitch with at least a ½” seam allowance. Finger-brush the nap of the fur straight down in the seam allowance. Don’t tuck the fur pile, or else you’ll end up with short fur piles poking through the seam, try to direct the fur pile as naturally as possible. Once sewn, brush out any caught fur piles within the seam.

When the nap is found, it’s helpful to mark an arrow on the back of the fur fabric to eliminate directional confusion when cutting out a pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Marking faux fur fabric is easy- since the backing is an extra thick knit, you can trace your pattern with a marker and it will not show through.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cuttingfauxfur\">Cutting Faux Fur:</h4>\n\n<p>When cutting faux fur, make small snips on the backing knit fabric only and avoid cutting the fur pile. You don’t want to cut the fur pile during cutting, it will result in uneven fur pile visible around the seams. </p>\n\n<p>You can also use a box cutter with a fresh, sharp blade to cut the fur backing. The razor blade cutting method is faster, but it can also distort the edges of the fabric. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%201%20-%20small%20snips-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Expert Tip: Use strips of packing tape along the cut fur edges to pick up any loose piles. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewingfurwithnoseamallowance\">Sewing Fur With No Seam Allowance:</h4>\n\n<p>With right sides together, tuck the fur pile in. Using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0334192/clover-wonder-clips\" target=\"_blank\">Wonder Clips</a> instead of pins – it’s better because the thickness of the fur will distort the fabric when pinned.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%202%20-%20tuck%20and%20wonder%20clips-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Expert Tip: Use a walking foot.</p>\n\n<p>Use a wide zig zag stitch along the edge. Sew slowly and use a lot of control on the fur as you sew. When opened, the seam is secure, minimal and almost invisible on the face of the fur fabric. This seam technique is great for most fur-to-fur projects, and will require pattern modifications to reduce the suggested seam allowance. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%203%20-%20zig%20zag%20stitch-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%204%20-%20no%20seam%20bulk-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%205%20-%20grey%20fur%20overhead-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sewingfurwithaseamallowance\">Sewing Fur With a Seam Allowance:</h4>\n\n<p>If you need to sew fur with a seam allowance, use a walking foot and a straight stitch with at least a ½” seam allowance. Finger-brush the nap of the fur straight down in the seam allowance. Don’t tuck the fur pile, or else you’ll end up with short fur piles poking through the seam, try to direct the fur pile as naturally as possible. Once sewn, brush out any caught fur piles within the seam. You’ll need to trim the fur pile within the seam allowance. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%206%20-%20sewing%20seam%20allowance-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Faux%20Fur/pic%207%20-%20bulky%20seam%20allowance-min.png\" alt=\"Mommy and Me Circle Skirts\" />\n</p> \n\n<p>Trimming the seam allowance: <br />\nTrim the fur pile as close to the backing as possible.

I personally recommend it in all of my pdf patterns, for both woven and knit designs.

Fusible means that it will bond to fabric when heated with an iron. The great thing is that it works for woven apparel fabrics as well as knit fabrics.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tricot](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Tricot-min.jpg)\n</p>\n  \nLeft: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3102/fusiknit-tricot-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">FusiKnit Tricot Fusible</a>\nRight: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293672/heatn-bond-q2432-tricot-fusible-sheer-weight-20-white\" target=\"_blank\">Heat’n Bond Q2432 Tricot Fusible</a>\n\n\nThere are so many different types of interfacing, and it can be confusing to decide which works best for your project. As a garment sewer, I use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible Interfacing for waistbands, collars, facings and plackets; I also use it as reinforcement for zippers, buttonholes and pockets. I work in both knit and woven fabrics, and I’ve found that <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible Interfacing works for most of my needs. Plus, I like the convenience of keeping one type of fusible on hand. I started this practice because when I worked in the apparel industry at a custom dress shop, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> was all we used. In that shop, we never worked with knit fabrics, but we did work in leather, lace, denim, silk, rayon and lots of other apparel fabrics. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> on woven fabric, and it wasn’t until recently that I realized that it wasn’t a common practice. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tricot](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Fringe%20Maxi6-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\nYou might be concerned that while <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> has stretch, your woven fabric does not. Not to worry; since the interfacing is heat bonded to the fabric, it will only stretch as much as your fabric stretches, and most woven fabric has a bit of crosswise stretch or give in the weave. If you are sewing with knit, then <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> is your best option for sure. When cutting, remember that <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> has a grain, make sure to match the grain of the fusible with the grain of your fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tricot](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Fringe%20Maxi12-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \nWhen you use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible Interfacing, you can maintain the original drape of the fabric while adding stability and structure when needed. For this sample, I used the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3102/fusiknit-tricot-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">FusiKnit Tricot</a> Fusible for the facings on my Fringe Dress. This collar shape in View B of the Fringe dress requires a nice, crisp corner, and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> is able to do that without being too stiff. It also works for View A, which has a curved neckline, by stabilizing the center front button closure.\n \nTo illustrate how fabric fused with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> can still maintain most of the fabric drape, I cut 8\" squares of this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0531021/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-menagerie-rayon-lawn-monstera-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Menagerie Rayon Lawn in Monstera Midnight</a> and tested a few fusible options, all from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>. The sample on the left is the fabric without any fusible. The two center samples are <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> options, and the far right sample uses a lightweight pellon fusible. You can see that the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> options look very similar to the fabric without any fusible. The Pellon option removes the natural drape of the fabric, and although it would still work for the Fringe pattern and most woven apparel projects, it’s just not my preference. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tricot](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/4drapeswatches-min.jpg)\n</p>\n   \n1) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0531021/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-menagerie-rayon-lawn-monstera-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rayon Lawn</a> -  without fusible\n2)  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3102/fusiknit-tricot-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">FusiKnit Tricot Fusible</a>\n3) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293672/heatn-bond-q2432-tricot-fusible-sheer-weight-20-white\" target=\"_blank\">Heat’n Bond Q2432 Tricot Fusible</a>\n4) <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3104/pellon-906f-sheer-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon 906F Sheer Fusible Interfacing</a>\n\nAfter testing these two <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> fusible options from Fabric.com, I would say both are very similar. If I had to pick, I prefer the FusiKnit <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible with a little more 2-way stretch than the Heat’n Bond Q2432 <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible, but both are comparable and I would recommend both.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tricot](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Fringe%20Maxi14-min.jpg)\n</p> \n\nI hope this gives you the confidence to try Tricot Fusible Interfacing on your next apparel project when you would like to maintain the fabric drape and feel while adding stability.

Fusible means that it will bond to fabric when heated with an iron. The great thing is that it works for woven apparel fabrics as well as knit fabrics.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Tricot-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tricot\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Left: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3102/fusiknit-tricot-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">FusiKnit Tricot Fusible</a> <br />\nRight: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293672/heatn-bond-q2432-tricot-fusible-sheer-weight-20-white\" target=\"_blank\">Heat’n Bond Q2432 Tricot Fusible</a></p>\n\n<p>There are so many different types of interfacing, and it can be confusing to decide which works best for your project. As a garment sewer, I use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible Interfacing for waistbands, collars, facings and plackets; I also use it as reinforcement for zippers, buttonholes and pockets. I work in both knit and woven fabrics, and I’ve found that <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> Fusible Interfacing works for most of my needs. Plus, I like the convenience of keeping one type of fusible on hand. I started this practice because when I worked in the apparel industry at a custom dress shop, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> was all we used. In that shop, we never worked with knit fabrics, but we did work in leather, lace, denim, silk, rayon and lots of other apparel fabrics. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> on woven fabric, and it wasn’t until recently that I realized that it wasn’t a common practice. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Tricot/Fringe%20Maxi6-min.jpg\" alt=\"Tricot\" />\n</p> \n\n<p>You might be concerned that while <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=tricot\" target=\"_blank\">Tricot</a> has stretch, your woven fabric does not.

I create bright, bold, colourful, and eclectic home decor and DIYs. I never met a pattern I didn't like, and some even call me a colour wizard.  \n\nWhile fall still has a few more weeks to go before it starts getting a little nippy, I am enjoying every minute of it by indulging in a picnic or tailgate. The only difference between a summer and fall picnic is the amount of fabrics involved, and this one called for lots of textures and colors from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>!\n\n####Fabric Choices for Fall Picnic\nFor this picnic I chose fabrics and materials in complimentary shades and patterns. Stripes, florals, and lots of fun reds are exactly what the occasion called for! I used:\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476802/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland-rose-garden-crimson\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co Wonderland Rose</a> for the napkins\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0461849/cloud-9-orangic-yarn-dye-shirting-plaid-shamrock-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9 Organic Yarn Died Shirting Plaid</a> for the food wrap and basket liner\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0513325/cotton-steel-noel-snow-leopard-red\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Noel Snow Leopard</a> for the tablecloth\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0336409/sunbrella-outdoor-mason-stripe-forest-green\" target=\"_blank\">Sunbrella Outdoor Mason Stripe Forest Green</a> for the outdoor pillows\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAlthough there's a large blanket for guests to sit on (because the ground was kind of wet and definitely cold) I always add an extra surface between the ground and food. I made a simple double-sided tablecloth using the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0513325/cotton-steel-noel-snow-leopard-red\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Noel Snow Leopard</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0336409/sunbrella-outdoor-mason-stripe-forest-green\" target=\"_blank\">Sunbrella Outdoor Mason Stripe Forest Green</a> outdoor fabric. This one can be used on its own at a picnic table, or even on the ground (because it's double sided). I essentially made a large pillow case, but didn't fill it. See below for pillow-case tutorial!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-17-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-10-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor napkins I went with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476802/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland-rose-garden-crimson\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co Wonderland Rose</a>. I love this little print for table linens, and actually used these napkins in my fall tablescape <a href=\"http://www.pmqfortwo.com/2017/10/plaid-and-eclectic-tablescape/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The details and flourishes of the florals are a nice compliment to the stripes and structure of the plaids.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Napkin-sewing.gif)\n</p>\n\nI cut the napkins to measure based on existing napkins that I like (18” x 18”), gave them a 1/2\" seam, and sewed them with a tight stitch. No need for fuss with these since they'll be used for the day to day instead of fancy occasions. I’ve illustrated the steps above.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-6-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-39-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhile sitting on the ground is fun as a kid, I find it less comfortable as an adult. When I picnic you'll often find me totting some large ground pillows or chairs, and for this event I chose to make some pillows using outdoor fabric. I wanted them to be UV resistant and moisture proof, and that's exactly what I got with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0336409/sunbrella-outdoor-mason-stripe-forest-green\">Sunbrella Outdoor Mason Stripe in Forest Green</a>. I chose the green stripe because it picks up on the stripes in the plaid, as well as in nature. It's another bold pattern that I can use going forward in other events. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/pillowase-sewing.gif)\n</p>\n\nI sewed the pillows like your normally do (inside-out) and then stuffed them before sewing the last seam closed by hand. I used old pillows for inserts to save on costs, considering these will be outdoor only.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-7-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-16-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOk so you've probably noticed the green check wrapped loaf. That's a delicious pumpkin loaf that I've been making for a few years now. It's essentially pumpkin spice muffins, but done in a loaf pan instead of muffin cups. I highly recommend with some cream cheese icing. For transport I didn't want bulky Tupperwares, or have to deal with them at the end of the picnic. Instead I wrapped my loaf in wax paper, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0461849/cloud-9-orangic-yarn-dye-shirting-plaid-shamrock-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9 Organic Yarn Died Shirting Plaid</a>, and twine.\n\nIt was perfect for transport within my picnic basket, and the fabric kept the wax paper from ripping or being punctured. I highly recommend when transporting baked goods going forward. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-12-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-15-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAnd finally, because we were outside, I brought along some extra fabric to serve as a makeshift shawl, as well as another picnic blanket in case more people joined-us. You never know what will happen when you're hanging out in a park on a lovely afternoon! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fall Picnic](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-40-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy fall sewing, everyone!\n\n",

I used old pillows for inserts to save on costs, considering these will be outdoor only.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-7-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fall Picnic\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-16-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fall Picnic\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Ok so you've probably noticed the green check wrapped loaf. That's a delicious pumpkin loaf that I've been making for a few years now. It's essentially pumpkin spice muffins, but done in a loaf pan instead of muffin cups. I highly recommend with some cream cheese icing. For transport I didn't want bulky Tupperwares, or have to deal with them at the end of the picnic. Instead I wrapped my loaf in wax paper, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0461849/cloud-9-orangic-yarn-dye-shirting-plaid-shamrock-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud 9 Organic Yarn Died Shirting Plaid</a>, and twine.</p>\n\n<p>It was perfect for transport within my picnic basket, and the fabric kept the wax paper from ripping or being punctured. I highly recommend when transporting baked goods going forward. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-12-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fall Picnic\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-15-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fall Picnic\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>And finally, because we were outside, I brought along some extra fabric to serve as a makeshift shawl, as well as another picnic blanket in case more people joined-us. You never know what will happen when you're hanging out in a park on a lovely afternoon! </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fall%20Fabric%20Picnic/Fall%20Outdoor%20Picnic%20PMQ%20fortwo-40-min.jpg\" alt=\"Fall Picnic\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy fall sewing, everyone!</p>",

This quick and easy tutorial gives you all the tools you need to sew two pet bed sizes- small and large!\n\nYou can use any fabric for your pet bed, but we recommend a durable fabric like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">outdoor</a> fabric, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=canvas\" target=\"_blank\">canvas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=duck\" target=\"_blank\">duck</a> or super durable <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?brands-and-designers=crypton\" target=\"_blank\">Crypton</a> fabric. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?brands-and-designers=crypton\" target=\"_blank\">Crypton</a> fabric has performance technology built into every fiber! Spills bead up and are easily wiped away, and odor resistance helps keep fabric fresh. Perfect for pups that aren’t good at keeping themselves clean!\n\nWe are proud to announce that fabric.com now carries 6 <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/crypton-home-exclusive-pet-designs\" target=\"_blank\">exclusive pet designs</a> from Crypton, which we used to create this bed for a resident fabric.com pup, Romeo.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Dog Bed](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Dog%20Bed/pet_bed_fabrics-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nLet's get started!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWrBwRg8LWA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Supplies Needed\n* 1 yard 54” wide <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?brands-and-designers=crypton\" target=\"_blank\">Crypton</a> fabric for small bed (we used the Dog Bones print in Denim from our <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/crypton-home-exclusive-pet-designs\" target=\"_blank\">Exclusive pet designs</a> collection)\n* 2 yards 54” wide <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?brands-and-designers=crypton\" target=\"_blank\">Crypton</a> fabric for large bed\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/pellon-pet-bed-inserts\" target=\"_blank\">Pet Bed Insert</a> \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=zippers\" target=\"_blank\">Invisible Zipper</a> – 20”\n* Invisible Zipper Foot \n* Heavy duty/<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=thread&usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">upholstery thread</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Dog Bed](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Dog%20Bed/supplies-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n*NOTE: The dimensions for the large bed will be in parentheses next to the small bed dimensions throughout. Use a ½” seam allowance unless noted otherwise.\n\n####Cutting\nCut two rectangles out of your pet bed fabric 21” x 31” (28” x 37”)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Dog Bed](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Dog%20Bed/cutting-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Insert Zipper\nInsert your favorite zipper with your favorite method if you want it to be removable. If not, skip this step.\n\nWe used an invisible zipper and zipper foot to create our invisible zipper. Remember to iron your zipper teeth out so you can get your needle as close to them as possible while sewing.\n\nPlace your zipper tape, teeth side in and sew with your invisible zipper foot 3” (4.5”) from each edge, careful not to twist and locking your stitches when you start and stop!\n\nTest your zipper to make sure it closes and opens. Trim excess and sew over the zipper on the ends to make sure you don’t lose that zipper head. Open the zipper part way.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIY Dog Bed](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Dog%20Bed/sew_zipper-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Sew\nSew around the rest of your rectangle, right sides together. You now have basically a pillowcase.

Remember to iron your zipper teeth out so you can get your needle as close to them as possible while sewing.</p>\n\n<p>Place your zipper tape, teeth side in and sew with your invisible zipper foot 3” (4.5”) from each edge, careful not to twist and locking your stitches when you start and stop!</p>\n\n<p>Test your zipper to make sure it closes and opens. Trim excess and sew over the zipper on the ends to make sure you don’t lose that zipper head. Open the zipper part way.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Dog%20Bed/sew_zipper-min.PNG\" alt=\"DIY Dog Bed\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sew\">Sew</h4>\n\n<p>Sew around the rest of your rectangle, right sides together.

They’re great for mixing and matching to brighten up a space, and you can use all your favorite patterns.

I serged the edges to all my pieces to prevent fraying.\nMC: Main color\nCC: Coordinating Color\n\n####Envelope Closure Method:\n\n#####Cut:\nMC: (1) 21”x21”\nCC: (2) 15” x 21”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_cut-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_cut2-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nThis is a great method for beginners, as it doesn’t require a zipper at all. It’s also a good choice if you plan on changing out your pillow covers often (great for holiday pillow covers!)\n\nThe premise is that you have two back pieces that are hemmed that overlap to completely encase your pillow form. It’s super easy and fast to whip these up.\n\n#####Steps:\nHem the two back pieces on one long side by folding over twice at ½” and sewing\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_hem-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPlace your main fabric right side up, and place your back pieces right side down and overlapping. The long and unhemmed edges will be on the top and bottom of your main fabric piece. It doesn’t matter which way you place it if your main fabric is non-directional.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_place_back_pieces-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew all the way around at ½”, locking your stitches when you start and stop. No need to leave a space to turn, your envelope closure is all you need!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_sew-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTrim your corners and turn, fill with your pillow form. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_finished-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Invisible Zipper Method:\nThis is probably the easiest method, but it does have one special requirement – an invisible zipper foot. You can purchase generic ones on Amazon for most machines, but the more expensive machines usually require you to buy a particular brand in order to fit. It’s a worthwhile investment, and by far the easiest way to add a zipper to garments and pillows! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_zipper.PNG)\n</p>\n\nIt requires only two pieces, and no visible stitching on the right side of the pillow. This is great for fabrics that are hard to top stitch or look best without top-stitching, like lighter weight faux leather, velvet, or if you don’t like cutting out very many pieces.\n\n#####Cut:\nMC: (1) 21” x 21”\nCC: (1) 21” x 21”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_cut-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_cut_2-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nIron your invisible zipper with the top of your iron flattening out the zipper teeth. This will make it easier to get close to the zipper teeth when sewing.\n\nPlace your invisible zipper on the right side and bottom of one pillow piece, with the teeth on the seam allowance (1/2”), the right side of the zipper tape facing the right side of the fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_place_zipper-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew this with your invisible zipper foot, your needle getting as close to the zipper teeth as possible without sewing over the teeth. If you sew over the teeth, you won’t be able to open your zipper!\n\nRepeat this on the other side. It’s okay if your zipper is twisted once, as long as you untwist it before you sew around the edges. It helps to have the two pieces butting up next to each other that you’re sewing the zipper tape to. \n\nClose the zipper to make sure everything zips up all right, but leave it half open before sewing the pieces together or you won’t be able to turn.\n\nSew the edges at ½” seam allowance, matching up the seam of the invisible zipper.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_sew-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTrim the extra zipper tape and the corners for a perfect finish, and turn. Stuff with your pillow form for a perfect pillow!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_finished.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Lapped Zipper Method:\nA lapped zipper creates a lovely professional pillow with a fully hidden zipper. It does require some extra pieces and a bit more steps while sewing but the finished product is so worth it. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_zipper.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Cut:\nMC: (1) 21” x 21”\nCC: (2) 21” x 11.5”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_cut.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_cut_2.PNG)\n</p>\n\nOn one back piece (right side up), place zipper right side down on one long side and sew along the edge with your zipper foot. Flip out and press. You can also top stitch on the backing fabric for a professional finish, but that is optional.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_zipper_foot.PNG)\n</p>\n\nOn the other back piece, fold over 1” and you can either just press, edgestitch, or hem based on your preference.\n\nRight sides facing up, place the folded/hemmed edge of one back piece over the zipper tape on the other piece. Pin or carefully keep in place. Using your zipper foot, top stitch next to the hidden top part of the zipper. Your zipper foot will ensure that you are sewing right next to the zipper teeth that you can’t see.  Go slowly and make sure you’re keeping everything lined up.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_together.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTest your zipper, leave it open halfway before sewing the pillow together\n\nSew all the way around your pillow with a ½” seam. Trim the corner and excess zipper tape.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_seam.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTurn using your open zipper.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_finished_pillow.PNG)\n</p>\n\n\n####Inset seam zipper\nThis zipper method is great for upholstery projects and it does not require an invisible zipper foot or zipper. You can use a standard zipper and zipper foot for this method, but it is a little nerve-wracking. We will sew the zipper on a closed seam and open it up using a seam ripper to expose the zipper. You will be able to see your bottom thread on the finished pillow. This is perfect for fabrics that won’t be damaged using a seam ripper too close to a seam. You can use this for almost anything!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_zipper_close-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Cut:\nMC: (1) 21” x 21”\nCC: (1) 21” x 21”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_cut-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_cut_2-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nRight sides together, sew the bottom seam. You can use a longer stitch length to make it easier to rip out later (3.5mm), or if you’re feeling confident, you can use a standard stitch length.\n\nPress this seam open and leave wrong side facing up to insert the zipper.\n\nLay your zipper on the back of your pressed open seam, zipper teeth right on top of the seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_lay_zipper-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew over the zipper tape on the wrong side with your zipper foot to get as close to the teeth as possible. Lock your stitches when beginning and ending. Unzip your zipper a little/enough so that the zipper head will be expose when you rip it out.\n\nTurn your pieces over to the right side. Insert the tip of your seam ripper into the stitches. You should be able to feel the zipper teeth with the seam ripper.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_remove_stitches-min.PNG)\n</p>\n \nCarefully rip out your line of stitches all the way down, exposing your zipper! Leave about 1” – 2” on either end unripped. \n\nOptional: stitch a perpendicular line on each end for extra durability.\n\nMake sure your zipper head is exposed as well. You may have to feed it in between the zipper tape and the enclosed seam. Unzip your zipper half way.\n\nRight sides together, sew all the way around at ½”, matching your seams from your zipper.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_half_inch_seam-min.PNG)\n</p>\n \nTrim zipper tape and corners. Turn and stuff.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Toss Pillows](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_finished-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nHappy pillow making!\n\n\n",

It’s also a good choice if you plan on changing out your pillow covers often (great for holiday pillow covers!)</p>\n\n<p>The premise is that you have two back pieces that are hemmed that overlap to completely encase your pillow form. It’s super easy and fast to whip these up.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"steps\">Steps:</h5>\n\n<p>Hem the two back pieces on one long side by folding over twice at ½” and sewing</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_hem-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Place your main fabric right side up, and place your back pieces right side down and overlapping. The long and unhemmed edges will be on the top and bottom of your main fabric piece. It doesn’t matter which way you place it if your main fabric is non-directional.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/envelope_place_back_pieces-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew all the way around at ½”, locking your stitches when you start and stop.

You can purchase generic ones on Amazon for most machines, but the more expensive machines usually require you to buy a particular brand in order to fit. It’s a worthwhile investment, and by far the easiest way to add a zipper to garments and pillows! </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_zipper.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>It requires only two pieces, and no visible stitching on the right side of the pillow. This is great for fabrics that are hard to top stitch or look best without top-stitching, like lighter weight faux leather, velvet, or if you don’t like cutting out very many pieces.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"cut\">Cut:</h5>\n\n<p>MC: (1) 21” x 21” <br />\nCC: (1) 21” x 21”</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_cut-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_cut_2-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Iron your invisible zipper with the top of your iron flattening out the zipper teeth. This will make it easier to get close to the zipper teeth when sewing.</p>\n\n<p>Place your invisible zipper on the right side and bottom of one pillow piece, with the teeth on the seam allowance (1/2”), the right side of the zipper tape facing the right side of the fabric. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_place_zipper-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew this with your invisible zipper foot, your needle getting as close to the zipper teeth as possible without sewing over the teeth. If you sew over the teeth, you won’t be able to open your zipper!</p>\n\n<p>Repeat this on the other side. It’s okay if your zipper is twisted once, as long as you untwist it before you sew around the edges. It helps to have the two pieces butting up next to each other that you’re sewing the zipper tape to. </p>\n\n<p>Close the zipper to make sure everything zips up all right, but leave it half open before sewing the pieces together or you won’t be able to turn.</p>\n\n<p>Sew the edges at ½” seam allowance, matching up the seam of the invisible zipper.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_sew-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Trim the extra zipper tape and the corners for a perfect finish, and turn. Stuff with your pillow form for a perfect pillow!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/invisible_finished.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"lappedzippermethod\">Lapped Zipper Method:</h4>\n\n<p>A lapped zipper creates a lovely professional pillow with a fully hidden zipper. It does require some extra pieces and a bit more steps while sewing but the finished product is so worth it. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_zipper.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"cut\">Cut:</h5>\n\n<p>MC: (1) 21” x 21” <br />\nCC: (2) 21” x 11.5”</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_cut.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_cut_2.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>On one back piece (right side up), place zipper right side down on one long side and sew along the edge with your zipper foot. Flip out and press. You can also top stitch on the backing fabric for a professional finish, but that is optional.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_zipper_foot.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>On the other back piece, fold over 1” and you can either just press, edgestitch, or hem based on your preference.</p>\n\n<p>Right sides facing up, place the folded/hemmed edge of one back piece over the zipper tape on the other piece. Pin or carefully keep in place. Using your zipper foot, top stitch next to the hidden top part of the zipper. Your zipper foot will ensure that you are sewing right next to the zipper teeth that you can’t see.  Go slowly and make sure you’re keeping everything lined up.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_together.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Test your zipper, leave it open halfway before sewing the pillow together</p>\n\n<p>Sew all the way around your pillow with a ½” seam. Trim the corner and excess zipper tape.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_sew_seam.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Turn using your open zipper.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/lapped_finished_pillow.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"insetseamzipper\">Inset seam zipper</h4>\n\n<p>This zipper method is great for upholstery projects and it does not require an invisible zipper foot or zipper. You can use a standard zipper and zipper foot for this method, but it is a little nerve-wracking. We will sew the zipper on a closed seam and open it up using a seam ripper to expose the zipper. You will be able to see your bottom thread on the finished pillow. This is perfect for fabrics that won’t be damaged using a seam ripper too close to a seam. You can use this for almost anything!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_zipper_close-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"cut\">Cut:</h5>\n\n<p>MC: (1) 21” x 21” <br />\nCC: (1) 21” x 21”</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_cut-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_cut_2-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Right sides together, sew the bottom seam. You can use a longer stitch length to make it easier to rip out later (3.5mm), or if you’re feeling confident, you can use a standard stitch length.</p>\n\n<p>Press this seam open and leave wrong side facing up to insert the zipper.</p>\n\n<p>Lay your zipper on the back of your pressed open seam, zipper teeth right on top of the seam.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_lay_zipper-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Sew over the zipper tape on the wrong side with your zipper foot to get as close to the teeth as possible. Lock your stitches when beginning and ending. Unzip your zipper a little/enough so that the zipper head will be expose when you rip it out.</p>\n\n<p>Turn your pieces over to the right side. Insert the tip of your seam ripper into the stitches. You should be able to feel the zipper teeth with the seam ripper.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_remove_stitches-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Carefully rip out your line of stitches all the way down, exposing your zipper! Leave about 1” – 2” on either end unripped. </p>\n\n<p>Optional: stitch a perpendicular line on each end for extra durability.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure your zipper head is exposed as well. You may have to feed it in between the zipper tape and the enclosed seam. Unzip your zipper half way.</p>\n\n<p>Right sides together, sew all the way around at ½”, matching your seams from your zipper.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_half_inch_seam-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Trim zipper tape and corners. Turn and stuff.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Toss%20Pillows%204%20Ways/inset_finished-min.PNG\" alt=\"Toss Pillows\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy pillow making!</p>",

Use ¼” seam allowance on the kites and an edged zig zag stitch on the clouds. Once the kites are flipped and pressed, no need to sew the opening closed. Once the clouds are flipped and stuffed, hand stitch closed the flip-openings on the clouds.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Frame%200_17-min.png)\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Frame%201_45-min.png)\n</p>\n\n\n####Box Kite:\nJoin the box kite fabric piece using with French seams. \n\nUse wire cutters to cut 4 skewers to equal 6 ½” and mark 1” inward on each end. Cut 4 skewers equaling 3 ¼”, mark the center (1 5/8”).\n\nHot glue the 3 ¼” skewers to the 6 ½” skewers as shown, using the 1” marks as joints. On one structure, glue the inner pieces just above the 1” mark, on the other, glue just below the 1” mark. Staggering the joints will allow the structure to be even height once completed. Continue as picture shows, generously hot gluing all joints, waiting at least 1-5 minutes per joint.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Box%20Kite%20Collage-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Skewer%20glue%20joint-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nLeave the box kite skewer structure to set overnight. Then simply pull the box kite fabric pieces over each end. Tie wire cord to the inside of the skewer structure, and decorate with fabric strips.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Naked%20Box%20Kite-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Fabric%20pulled%20over%20box%20kite-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Box%20Kite%20done-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nFor assembling the mobile, intersect two 6’ pieces of twine and knot at four evenly spaced points on the embroidery hoop.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Frame%202_34-min.png)\n</p>\n\n####Attaching the Mobile Center\nAttach the big cloud to the box kite. Insert needle through the bottom of the cloud, secure and knot, leave 10 ½” of twine, then double knot around the inner structure of the box kite. Attach large cloud to small cloud till a 7 ½” length of twine is achieved.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Center%20cloud%20attaching-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Center%20mobile%20piece-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake 4’ of twine and insert it through the top of the cloud with an embroidery needle. Once poked through the bottom, loop in the twine intersection that’s attached to the hoop.\n \nInsert the needle back up into the cloud, and knot to secure. Bury the thread to hide any loose ends. The mobile should now be adjustable from the cloud. Once hung, the weight of the mobile will secure the setting. \n\nKite and Cloud attachments:  Follow this diagram for how long each kite or cloud should hang down. Attach twine at the skewer intersections. Bury the thread to hide the loose ends.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Frame%203_31-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Kites Clouds Mobile](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Kites%20and%20Clouds%20Nursery%20Mobile/Bury%20Thread%20Kites.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You would think at first that this was a match made in heaven, but to be honest, for years I was intimidated to try such projects.

Spandex, for example, is a popular material used as a base layer to soak up sweat. \n* Athletic knits are mostly made with synthetic fibers like spandex, nylon, and polyester, though, we are seeing more made with natural fibers like bamboo as well. \n\n####My other go-to supplies:\n* <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/collection/coats-and-clark-surelock-overlock-thread\" target=\"_blank\">Coat’s Surelock thread </a>\n* <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/buy/0372039/non-roll-elastic-1x2-1-2yd-white\" target=\"_blank\">Dritz  1” non-roll elastic</a> \n* Stretch or Ball Point Needle\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-285/schmetz-twin-machine-needle-2-80\" target=\"_blank\">Twin Needle</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/construction%20photos-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/construction1-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####The Pattern\nBecause fit, function, and support are the most important aspects of athletic apparel, make sure you find a pattern that is made for this and your size. \n\n* Be prepared to make a sample and edit according to your body measurements.  I know for me in making these leggings, I had to take them in a few times to get them to fit. \n* Be sure to take notes along the way and edit the pattern accordingly.  For example, if you had to increase the seam allowance or add length to the hem by 1”, mark this on the pattern for next time.\n* Consider creating a pattern from your favorite fitness garments. This is done by laying the garment flat on a sheet of pattern paper and tracing it. This is especially easy for leggings that have just a front and back pattern. For a legging that has several sections (like mine), it could be a bit trickier, so try a pattern like this one <a href=\" http://www.burdastyle.com/pattern_store/patterns/athletic-leggings-012017--3?utm_source=burdastyle.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bs-tta-bl-170102-CoolRunningCollection106A  \" target=\"_blank\">here</a> \n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/serger%203%20thread-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####The Construction \nLet’s dive into some of the sewing techniques used to make athletic apparel and show you how to do some of these yourself.  If you notice on your athletic apparel, most of it is made with an overlock stitch. This usually done by a serger or coverstitch machine using most often the flatlock stitch. This is great for fitness wear because it offers strength and stretch with the least abrasion possible against the skin. This is done with a serger using 3 –needle threads. You can also use this technique for hemming the edges as well.  The serger I have is a Brother 1034DX that works great for all my knit projects from fitness to ready wear. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/flatlock%20stitch%20side%201%20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/flatlock%20stitch%20side%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Flatlock Stitch\nWhen you sew a flatlock stitch, you will alter the settings of the serger and usually use three threads and the left needle. This stitch attaches the pieces together so they lay flat as if they were one whole piece of fabric. The top side creates rows of parallel lines like a ladder, and the bottom side is the typical overlock look. You can decide which one you prefer to be your outer seam by altering how you serge them together. I use both, and you can see in the below photo how I used them together. If you look at most professional athletic wear, they usually are done with a flatlock seam.  \n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/flatlock%20stitches-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/Flatlockstitch%20combine%20on%20garment-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n#####Zigzag Stitch\nIf you don’t have a serger, the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine will do the job. This is used on seams that need stretch so the threads won’t break when stretched. It can also be used along the hems as well. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/twin%20needle%20a-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/twin%20needle%20b-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/twin%20needle%20hem-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Twin Needle\nFor the hem, I like to serge the raw edges for a clean finish, and then use a twin needle to top stitch the hem allowance into place. This is how most clothing (fitness to ready to wear) is finished.  A twin needle is used as a decorative stitch that produces parallel lines along the top and zigzag threads on the bottom to allow the threads to stretch when pulled (like pushing your legs through the pant sleeve or pulling a shirt over your head).\n\nFor my leggings, I wanted a pop of pattern and a solid navy/blue. I went with <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/buy/0539013/supplex-athletic-knit-new-navy \" target=\"_blank\">Supplex Athletic Knit in navy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0539711/flutter-butterfly-printed-athletic-knit-multi\" target=\"_blank\">this butterfly flutter athletic knit </a>.  I also wanted a matching top. This t-shirt with the open back was a pattern I made myself as well as the white tank with the mesh racer back. \n\nFor the racer back top, I used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0395284/telio-mod-stretch-mesh-white\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Mod Stretch Mesh White</a> and <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/buy/up-279/telio-stretch-bamboo-rayon-jersey-knit-white\n\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Stretch Bamboo Rayon Jersey Knit White</a>.\n\nEither way, don’t let the intimidation of making athletic wear deter you from going for it. You might find your own custom look is the key to looking great while doing a workout....and it might even make you work harder, too.\n\nHappy sewing!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing Athletic Wear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20with%20Athletic%20Fabrics/DSC_0369-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They can be displayed in your tree. They can be strung as a garland. They can be hung from your windows. Anything! But the best part? The fabric choice isn’t permanent so you can change your Christmas décor style, color or theme Every. Single. Year. Yay for versatility! Psst. Here are the hoop ornaments I made last year.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%20last%20year-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nIt’s a little early but since Christmas is my absolute favorite time of year, I’ve had my decorating wheels turning for a bit and think this is where I’m headed with my décor this year.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI thrifted this beautiful blanket a couple months ago thinking 1. It’s the happiest blanket of all times…I must add it to my collection. And 2. It would make an awesome, fun, whimsical Christmas tree skirt. Did you know you don’t even have to use an actual tree skirt as a tree skirt? It never occurred to me until last year.\n\nWith this great blanket in mind, I thought about the staples we have at Christmas and then the colors I used year-round in our home. Our red gingham stockings are a must. Green is a big deal around here and a fair amount of pink. With these things in mind, I chose a few Cotton + Steel fabrics that I love. (I love all of their fabrics.

This last one is very small scale but pulls in green—my favorite—and still has the lighter background to stand out in the tree.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/fabric%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%204-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI chose the 4” embroidery hoops but depending on the size of your tree, you might be able to get away with using larger ones.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/step%201-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou unscrew the tops of the embroidery hoops. They’re made up of two rings with the outside ring being tightened to hold the inside ring in. Put the fabric, right side down, on top of the outside of the hoop.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/step%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAdjust the fabric over the outside hoop making sure it’s not wrinkled (or crooked if it’s a directional fabric). Also, make sure you position it as close to the edge as you can so that you don’t have much waste.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/step%203-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPush the inside hoop over the fabric and into the outside hoop.

Cut as close to the edge as possible. If you tightened it enough, the fabric won’t slip and the finished product will look nicer without scraps hanging off the back.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%205-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nDon’t they look so pretty?

They would be so cute one attached to each stocking as a stocking tag with an initial or a name printed on top of the fabric. They’d be nice hanging from a window as ornaments for the neighbors to view. Ours will end up in our tree as ornaments.

I’m Jessica from <a href=\"http://www.househomemade.us/\" target=\"_blank\">House Homemade</a> and I’m so happy to be invited by fabric.com to tell you about this super simple, big impact Christmas craft I made. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%201-min.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>These ornaments made from awesome fabric I picked from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a> and small <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">embroidery hoops</a>. They can be displayed in your tree. They can be strung as a garland. They can be hung from your windows. Anything! But the best part? The fabric choice isn’t permanent so you can change your Christmas décor style, color or theme Every. Single. Year. Yay for versatility! Psst. Here are the hoop ornaments I made last year.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%20last%20year-min.JPG\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>It’s a little early but since Christmas is my absolute favorite time of year, I’ve had my decorating wheels turning for a bit and think this is where I’m headed with my décor this year.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%202-min.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I thrifted this beautiful blanket a couple months ago thinking 1. It’s the happiest blanket of all times…I must add it to my collection. And 2. It would make an awesome, fun, whimsical Christmas tree skirt. Did you know you don’t even have to use an actual tree skirt as a tree skirt? It never occurred to me until last year.</p>\n\n<p>With this great blanket in mind, I thought about the staples we have at Christmas and then the colors I used year-round in our home. Our red gingham stockings are a must. Green is a big deal around here and a fair amount of pink. With these things in mind, I chose a few Cotton + Steel fabrics that I love. (I love all of their fabrics. They’re so fun and pretty.)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Embroidery%20Hoop%20Holiday%20Ornaments/photo%203-min.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Fabric 1: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476802/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland-rose-garden-crimson\" target=\"_blank\">Wonderland Rose Garden Crimson </a>(this fabric is currently unavailable but you can view the entire collection <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland\" target=\"_blank\">here</a)</p>\n\n<p>I picked this as my show stopper.

You can also use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">pattern material with printed gridlines</a>. Either method will help you draw the dimensions evenly. Smooth out any wrinkles and try to correct any fabric warping. Mark any corners with a pencil outside of the seam allowance. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/0_15%20Mark%20Corners-min.png)\n</p>\n\nUse a measuring tape to measure bust, waist and hips or any other important measurement based on the garment being traced. Divide that by 2, and use a pin to poke through the fabric onto the tracing paper for each measurement taken to form half of the front sweater piece. The same line will be the edge for the back pattern piece. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/0_42%20Measure%20and%20Poke-min.png)\n</p>\n\nTake your pin and poke through the seam allowance to create a dot-to dot outline of the garment. Use this technique on any seam that the tracing paper isn’t immediately visible to trace directly.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/Pin%20hole%20close%20up-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRemove your garment and continue drawing the pattern. Connect the pinhole dots, and trace the outlines accounting for a seam allowance and hem.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/1_05%20Hem%20and%20seam%20allowance-min.png)\n</p>\n\nContinue to do this for the back piece, and the sleeve piece.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/0_51%20Pin%20poke%20in%20action-min.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/2_06%20Pattern%20Pieces%20done-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMeasure and apply any finishings needed such as cuffs or neck binding. We used the measured knit band method from this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-101-attaching-knit-bands/\" target=\"_blank\">knits tutorial</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/2_14%20Finishings-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTip: The garment will more than likely have some manipulation due to assembly and being worn in high-function areas, such as shoulders. Find the grain of the fabric and manipulate the fabric to follow the grain as needed to acquire appropriate pattern dimensions. \n\nTip: If the fabric you’re using doesn’t match the characteristics of the garment being copied, account for that by adding or subtracting dimensions to account for stretch percentage. The Telio Topaz Hatchi Knit Fuchsia fabric we used to copy the green sweater has 75% stretch, and the green sweater has a little more than that, so we added ¼” to the seam allowances to account for the different stretches. \n\nTip: Make notes on each pattern piece like naming it, how many to cut, seam allowance used, fabric recommendations and date created. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/Pattern%20Notes-min.jpg)\n</p\n\n(Picture: 2_27 side by side)\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Embroidery Hoop Ornaments]( https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/2_27%20Side%20by%20side-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\n\n",

We used the measured knit band method from this <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-101-attaching-knit-bands/\" target=\"_blank\">knits tutorial</a>. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\" https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/2_14%20Finishings-min.JPG\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Tip: The garment will more than likely have some manipulation due to assembly and being worn in high-function areas, such as shoulders. Find the grain of the fabric and manipulate the fabric to follow the grain as needed to acquire appropriate pattern dimensions. </p>\n\n<p>Tip: If the fabric you’re using doesn’t match the characteristics of the garment being copied, account for that by adding or subtracting dimensions to account for stretch percentage. The Telio Topaz Hatchi Knit Fuchsia fabric we used to copy the green sweater has 75% stretch, and the green sweater has a little more than that, so we added ¼” to the seam allowances to account for the different stretches. </p>\n\n<p>Tip: Make notes on each pattern piece like naming it, how many to cut, seam allowance used, fabric recommendations and date created. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\" https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/Pattern%20Notes-min.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p\n\n(Picture: 2_27 side by side)\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\" https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Pattern%20Drafting/2_27%20Side%20by%20side-min.JPG\" alt=\"Embroidery Hoop Ornaments\" />\n</p>",

All the details on the houses are pieces of fabric cut out for the designs so it's super easy to decorate and customize them.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30712\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Christmas-Town-Fabric-House.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1392\" />\n\nI just love all these little whimsical details.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30716\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Whimsical-Fabric-Christmas-Village.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"590\" />\n\n####Pattern Download\nDownload the DIY Holiday Village pattern here:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Fabric Houses, Doors and Windows Patterns</strong></a></p>\nThe patterns have a variety of house and roof shapes - feel free to mix and match those up so your houses all look a bit different. Choose doors and windows that have shapes that work with the images you are fussy cutting from the fabrics. It's fun to plan it all out!\n\nI'll walk you through one of the houses but they're all constructed with the same steps.  For all the houses, measure up 1\" from the bottom and then start your details like doors and windows.\n\nFor the little clothes line I drew a line with a disappearing marking pen for the line guide. Cut out socks and hats from the fabric and iron these to the fusible webbing. Trim around the shapes and remove the paper backing. Iron the socks, hats, and door and window to the front of the house.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30711\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Applique-detail-on-Christmas-houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" />\n\nStitch around everything with the black Aurifil thread two or three times. I like to use a free motion foot and just do a sketched stitch look.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30710\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stitching-Details-on-Christmas-Houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" />\n\nSew the roof pieces to the front and back of the house pieces. If you want, add in trim to the top of the house before or after your roof is sewn on.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30709\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-roofs-of-Christmas-Houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\nIf you are adding a chimney to your roof, cut a piece of heavyweight interfacing and fuse this to one side of the chimney pieces. Sew the pieces together on three sides, leaving the bottom edge open. Turn right side out and press.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30722\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chimney-Piece.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1066\" />\n\nIf you're adding a chimney to a curved or triangle roof, your chimney will need to be perpendicular to the roof edge. So the roof will actually be pointing sideways inside the front and back of the roof pieces as you sew them together. This will allow it to stand up straight when turned right side out. If you're adding a chimney to a straight roof, just sew it in pointing downwards.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30721\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-Chimney-in-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\nPlace the front and back of the house right sides together and sew around the pieces with a 1/4\" seam allowance. Leave an opening in the side of the house for turning right side out. Clip all the curves and pointed edges.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30708\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-front-and-back-of-houses-together.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" />\n\nBring the bottom edge of the house up to match the side edge at the corner to form a point in the bottom corner. Sew a seam across this point 1\" from the pointed end. This will make a box pleat in the bottom of the house and allow the house to stand up straight. Repeat for the other corner of the house.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30707\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-Box-Pleats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"737\" />\n\nTrim the corner edge off just outside of the seam. Turn the house right side out and press.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30720\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Colorful-Christmas-House.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" />\n\nCut a piece of cardboard the size of the box pleat section on the base of the house.

All the details on the houses are pieces of fabric cut out for the designs so it's super easy to decorate and customize them.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30712\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Christmas-Town-Fabric-House.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1392\" /></p>\n\n<p>I just love all these little whimsical details.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30716\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Whimsical-Fabric-Christmas-Village.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"590\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"patterndownload\">Pattern Download</h4>\n\n<p>Download the DIY Holiday Village pattern here:  </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Fabric Houses, Doors and Windows Patterns</strong></a></p>  \n\n<p>The patterns have a variety of house and roof shapes - feel free to mix and match those up so your houses all look a bit different. Choose doors and windows that have shapes that work with the images you are fussy cutting from the fabrics. It's fun to plan it all out!</p>\n\n<p>I'll walk you through one of the houses but they're all constructed with the same steps.  For all the houses, measure up 1\" from the bottom and then start your details like doors and windows.</p>\n\n<p>For the little clothes line I drew a line with a disappearing marking pen for the line guide. Cut out socks and hats from the fabric and iron these to the fusible webbing. Trim around the shapes and remove the paper backing. Iron the socks, hats, and door and window to the front of the house.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30711\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Applique-detail-on-Christmas-houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p>Stitch around everything with the black Aurifil thread two or three times. I like to use a free motion foot and just do a sketched stitch look.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30710\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stitching-Details-on-Christmas-Houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p>Sew the roof pieces to the front and back of the house pieces. If you want, add in trim to the top of the house before or after your roof is sewn on.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30709\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-roofs-of-Christmas-Houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you are adding a chimney to your roof, cut a piece of heavyweight interfacing and fuse this to one side of the chimney pieces. Sew the pieces together on three sides, leaving the bottom edge open. Turn right side out and press.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30722\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chimney-Piece.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1066\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you're adding a chimney to a curved or triangle roof, your chimney will need to be perpendicular to the roof edge. So the roof will actually be pointing sideways inside the front and back of the roof pieces as you sew them together. This will allow it to stand up straight when turned right side out. If you're adding a chimney to a straight roof, just sew it in pointing downwards.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30721\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-Chimney-in-roof.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>Place the front and back of the house right sides together and sew around the pieces with a 1/4\" seam allowance. Leave an opening in the side of the house for turning right side out. Clip all the curves and pointed edges.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30708\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-front-and-back-of-houses-together.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p>Bring the bottom edge of the house up to match the side edge at the corner to form a point in the bottom corner. Sew a seam across this point 1\" from the pointed end. This will make a box pleat in the bottom of the house and allow the house to stand up straight. Repeat for the other corner of the house.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30707\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sewing-Box-Pleats.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"737\" /></p>\n\n<p>Trim the corner edge off just outside of the seam. Turn the house right side out and press.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30720\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Colorful-Christmas-House.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p>Cut a piece of cardboard the size of the box pleat section on the base of the house. Most of mine were 1 1/2\" x 3\" but you'll want to double-check yours. Slide the cardboard into the base of the house, then stuff the house with fiberfill. Hand sew the opening closed.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-30719\" src=\"http://www.flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Little-Fabric-Christmas-House.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1261\" /></p>\n\n<p>Repeat for all the other houses you'd like to make!

These custom woven panels feature seam allowance on each stocking. Keep along these lines and match them for your lining for a perfect finished product!\n\n*Tip for sewing with jacquards: Since this is a custom woven jacquard with many different colors, the edges are prone to fraying when cut. Sew together as soon as possible after cutting and don’t handle the edges too much.\n\n####Step 1\nCut out your two pieces from the jacquard stocking panel. Use these as a pattern to cut two corresponding pieces out of your lining fabric. If you’re a beginner, we recommend using quilting cotton for lining. It will be easiest to work with. Satin and velvet will shift when being sewn. Cotton velvet or velveteen is also a good option, but it will make for a bulkier lining. We used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0544826/acetex-cotton-velvet-forest\" target=\"_blank\">this cotton velvet</a>.\n\nAlso cut a small piece of your lining that is 1.5”x6” for a hanging loop.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 2\nSew one matching main piece and one lining piece together along the top edge. Repeat for the other corresponding main and lining pieces.\n\n####Step 3 \nCreate a loop for turning by sewing the long sides together on the 1.5”x6” piece and turning. If you have a turning or stuffing fork, that works great. You can also use a pencil or knitting needle!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nPlace the folded loop piece on the right side of one main stocking piece. Pin or baste in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Step 5 \nPin main stocking pieces right sides together, leaving an opening in the lining for turning. Backstitch over the place where the loop is, making sure that your loop stays stacked on top of itself. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6\nTurn stocking right side out through the hole left in the lining. Close the hole in the lining now with a hand slip stich or by machine. Nest the lining into the stocking now.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/5-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Step 7\nYou can topstitch the top of the stocking so the lining stays neatly, or you can skip this step. \n\nYou now have an heirloom stocking with a loop for hanging by the fire with care!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Cut%20%26%20Sew%20Stockings/IMG_7442-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHappy holiday sewing!\n",

I’m Sara from <a href=\"https://thesaraproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Sara Project</a> and I’m here to talk all about coat sewing today. \n\nCoat season is upon us and sewing a coat has been at the top of my list! I’m really excited to be collaborating with fabric.com to make the fall coat of my dreams. Deciding on what coat to sew and what fabric to use can be a bit overwhelming. (There are so many options!). Today I’m going to help prepare you for your own coat-sewing journey!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/IMG_6107.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFirst things first, you need to decide on a pattern! If you’re not sure what style suits you best, I would suggest trying on a few ready to wear coats first to see what styles work well with your body type. I also like to spend time looking for inspiration online by searching ‘Fall 2017 Coat Trends’  (for example) to get some ideas of what is current in fashion. I also really love using an online resource called <a href=\"https://thefoldline.com/patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">The Foldline</a> to search different types of patterns. Go with a design you’re drawn to, but that is also practical for your lifestyle. Sewing a coat is a big investment of both your money and time, and you want to make sure you’re making something you will really love. Down below I’ve included 6 of my current favorite coat patterns to give you a few ideas. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/IMG_6104.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####My top 6 coat patterns:\n\n1) <a href=\"https://store.closetcasepatterns.com/products/clare-coat-sewing-pattern \" target=\"_blank\">Closet Case Files Claire Coat</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo6.jpg)\n</p>\n\n2) <a href=\"https://indiesew.com/products/grainline-studio-cascade-duffle-coat#product\" target=\"_blank\">Grainline Studio Cascade Duffle Coat</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n3) <a href=\"https://www.christinehaynes.com/collections/pdf-sewing-patterns/products/ellsworth-coat-pdf-sewing-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Haynes Ellsworth Coat </a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n4.) <a href=\"https://www.namedclothing.com/shop/gaia-quilted-coat/ \" target=\"_blank\">Named Clothing Gaia Quilted Coat </a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n5) <a href=\"https://www.namedclothing.com/shop/yona-wrap-coat/ \" target=\"_blank\">Yona Wrap Coat</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo4.jpg)\n</p>\n\n6) <a href=\"https://papercutpatterns.com/collections/jackets-coats/products/sapporo-coat \" target=\"_blank\">Papercut Patterns Sapparo Coat</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo5.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI decided to sew the <a href=\"https://indiesew.com/products/grainline-studio-cascade-duffle-coat#product\" target=\"_blank\">Cascade Duffle Coat by Grainline Studio</a>. I picked this pattern because I loved the option to be able to play with plaids directionally, but I also love the versatility of the design. I’m a mom to two young toddlers (with another one on the way) and I really need something that works well with jeans and a sweater but that could also be dressed up for church or a date night. I’m so happy with the results and I know I’ll be wearing this coat for years to come. The pattern itself is great. The instructions are very clear, and easy to follow. This project took me quite a bit of time but it wasn’t very complicated. I sewed up a size 4 for reference with no modifications. I did have a little trouble with the lining length on the hood and back bodice. I just simply cut off the excess and then everything fit perfectly. I would totally recommend this pattern! \n\n####Fabric Choices\nOnce you’ve decided on your coat pattern, it’s time to choose your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>! I would suggest choosing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> based off of what your pattern recommends to use. If this is your first time sewing a coat, I would advise choosing a solid colored <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> so you don’t have to worry about matching plaids or patterns. If you do decide to go with a plaid, like I did, make sure to get a little extra <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. (I would recommend getting about an extra yard). One more quick tip, if you are ordering your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> online, I would highly recommend ordering a swatch of the fabric you like to make sure the color, texture and pattern scale is right for your coat. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric.com</a> has a lot of affordable wool options for your coat, and down below I’ve included some of my favorites: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/IMG_6111.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Solids:\n\nMagenta: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0418958/the-seasons-melton-wool-collection-magenta\" target=\"_blank\">The Seasons Melton Wool Collection Magenta</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo7.jpg)\n</p>\n\nGray: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0511302/riley-blake-melton-wool-blend-gray\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Melton Wool Blend Gray</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo8.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNavy: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0511295/riley-blake-melton-wool-blend-navy \" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Melton Wool Blend Navy</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo9.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOlive: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0462995/telio-wool-blend-melton-olive \" target=\"_blank\">Telio Wool Blend Melton Olive</a> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo10%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Plaids:\n\nP/Kaufmann Glamis Sumac: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0535645/p-kaufmann-wool-blend-melton-glamis-sumac \" target=\"_blank\">P Kaufmann Wool Blend melton Glamis Sumac</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/photo11.jpg)\n</p>\n\nP/Kaufmann Glamis Camel: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0535646/p-kaufmann-wool-blend-melton-glamis-camel\" target=\"_blank\">P/Kaufmann Wool Blend Melton Glamis Camel</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/0535646%20%281%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\nP/Kaufmann Aberdeen Frost: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0535613/p-kaufmann-wool-blend-melton-aberdeen-frost\" target=\"_blank\">P Kaufmann Wool Blend Melton Aberdeen Frost</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/0535613%20%281%29.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAlong with the main shell fabric of your coat, you will most likely need a lining to go with it. Most patterns recommend using a bemberg rayon lining and Fabric.com has some great options. I chose to use the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?searchText=bemberg+rayon\" target=\"_blank\">camel Bemberg Rayon</a> lining for my coat.\n\nYou also want to make sure you use the correct interfacing with your coat. It will make all the difference! Depending on what style coat you are making, and what you prefer to work with, here are three great interfacing options to use for coat sewing. For the cascade duffle coat, I would suggest using the tailor’s fusible interfacing:\n\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0343315/pellon-855f-tailors-elite-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon 855F Tailors Elite Fusible Interfacing</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293658/23-stitchn-sew-woven-sew-in-interfacing-hair-canvas-natural\" target=\"_blank\">23 Stitch N Sew Woven Sew In Interfacing</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=fusible+weft\" target=\"_blank\">Fusible Weft</a>\n\n\n####Before you begin sewing, here are a few more tips to consider. \n\n1. Make sure to check the care instructions of your fabric before cutting out your pattern. Most wool fabrics are dry clean only. If this is the case, a great way to prep your fabric is by steam pressing your wool to pre-shrink it. If your wool fabric is machine washable, test out a swatch in your washing machine first just to be safe.\n\n2. When you’re working with wool, the seams can become very thick. It’s always a good idea to grade all of your seams to help reduce the bulk of your coat seams. \n\n3. Last but not least, make sure to really focus on pressing each seam of your coat really well. A well-pressed coat is a professional looking coat! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Cut and Sew Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Coat%20Making%20Tips/IMG_6108.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\nThanks for reading along and best of luck to you on your coat-sewing journey!\n\n\n",

I experimented with different widths and ended up with a mix of fabric strips ranging in width from 1.75” to 2.5” wide. I started with thinner strips but in the end I wanted to be able to see as much of the prints on each fabric as possible so I cut them wider. When the prints have cute faces you don’t want to chop them up! So, depending on the print you choose to work with, test a few strips in different widths and see what you like. \n\nLine up your ruler with the edge of your fabric. Here you see it lined up at the 2.5” mark.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0011-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAnd cut. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0012-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce all your fabrics are cut, take your string or ribbon and secure the ends around a table or cutting mat to keep it in place. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0014-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake a strip of fabric and fold it in half. Then slip the folded side under the string. \n\nOpen up the fold.\n\nTake the two ends over the string and slip it through the folded end. \n\nPull the ends and voila, you’ve got your first fabric garland piece in place! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0015-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake another strip of fabric and repeat steps 1-4 and keep on going until you’ve added strips to fit your desired fabric garland width. \n\nOnce you’ve added enough strips, tie loops on each end of the string to hang it up. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0016-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTadaaaaa! Super easy and fun!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0017-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis garland makes for a festive backdrop to a table spread for the holidays too. It’s easy to add a little fun to a wall and with a cute christmas tree, even better! \n\nIt’s really easy to customize the width too. If it’s not wide enough, add more strips. If it’s too wide, take off a few strips. \n\nSo by now you’re probably wondering about the need for the optional tools mentioned in the beginning. Well, did you notice how cut those llamas are? I mean, come on, leg warmers, pompoms and sweaters! So cute! I just had to make a bunting with the llamas! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0019-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAlso no sewing required here either! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0020-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou can make a bunting, decorate the christmas tree with them, or even just use them individually to decorate the table and walls!\n\nHere are the steps to making the llama bunting:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0021-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace your print fabric facing down. Then take a sheet of the Pellon Lite EZ-Steam II and trace around the shape you want to cut out. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0022-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut the Pellon and remove one side of the paper backing. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0023-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nStick it onto the back of the fabric and cut it out. You can reposition the Pellon so don’t worry if you don’t place it right the first time. It won’t be permanent until you iron it. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0024-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIf you have pinking shears, you can use them to cut out the shapes too. \n\nClip your shapes onto string with mini clothes pins and you’ve got yourself a super fun bunting! \n\nThat’s all from me this time and I hope you have fun making your own fabric garland and bunting. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![No Sew Fabric Garland](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/No%20Sew%20Garland/2017-11-15_0018-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy holiday sewing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Cut and sew faux fur fabric using tips from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgr9szzN0_A\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>.\n\n####Step 3\nSew both liner and face fabric with 3/8” seam allowance. On the stocking piece, grade, clip and notch the seam allowance, flip and press.\nFor the liner piece, leave an opening at the bottom in order to eventually flip the stocking rightside out. Trim the seam allowance down to ¼” so that it fits well within the face fabric. Tip: press the opening ¼” upward, it will make topstitching easier in step 5.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/Pressed%20opening-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nLayer the face fabric and cuff as shown in the video. Line the seam up on the outer seam of the stocking. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/Layered%20stocking-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nKeeping the lining wrong-side out, layer it on top and use Wonder Clips to secure.\n\nSew ½” around the top, and flip rightside out using the opening in the liner piece.\n\n####Step 5\nOnce the stocking is flipped, top stitch the opening within the lining.\nTip: Since faux fur is on a heavy knit backing, there’s no need to hem the fur cuff edge, it won’t unravel!\n\n####Step 6 (Optional Faux Fur Poms)\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/IMG_7490-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThese are so fun to make! Sew the ribbon onto the faux fur circles, make sure the fur nap is facing downward. Hand baste stitch with doubled thread around and use a scrap fabric piece in the center to help give it shape. Pull the thread tightly, pinching the fabric and stitch closed. \n\n*Tip: Use your finger to loop the thread to keep fur fibers out of the stitches. These fur poms would make great ornaments, garland, or giftable accents to purses and keychains!\n\n####More Fabric Suggestions\nHere are some of other suggestions for these flannel and fur stockings, if buffalo plaid isn’t your style!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0329710/udder-madness-cow-upholstery-milk\" target=\"_blank\">Udder Madness Cow Upholstery Milk</a> with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0386363/shannon-faux-fur-golden-wolf-gold-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Faux Fur Golden Wolf Gold/Brown</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/Cow%20and%20Brown%20Fur%20side%20by%20side%20fabric-min.JPG)\n\n</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0394757/p-kaufmann-obsession-velvet-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">P Kaufmann Obsessions Velvet Midnnight</a>  with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/bu-291/shannon-faux-fur-luxury-shag-white\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Faux Fur Luxury Shag White</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/Blue%20Velvet%20and%20white%20fur%20side%20by%20side%20fabric-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Stockings](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Flannel%20and%20Fur%20Stocking/IMG_5976-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n",

First, cut a square of fabric 4 times the size of the box you are wrapping. Position the box in the center of the underside of the fabric (see video).\n\nNext, fold the corner of the fabric over so that it touches the other length of the box. Fold the opposite corner over the box, folding under any extra bits of fabric.\n\nUsing the two opposite corners, tie a knot above the box. We tied a double not to make it extra secure! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wrapping](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wrapping/tiedknotbox.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wrapping](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wrapping/Untitled%20Catalog17732-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Technique 2: The Standard Box\nNext is the standard box method. For this technique you will wrap a present much like you would with regular wrapping paper.\n\nMeasure and cut a piece of fabric to cover the box much like you would with paper gift wrap.\n\nStart wrapping the gift like you normally would, but instead of using tape, using pins to hold the fabric in place.\n\nWhen it gets time to add the ribbon, pull it extra tight so that when you pull out the pins the fabric stays where it is.\n\nOnce the ribbon and bow are tight, pull the pins from the box. Make sure you get 'em all!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wrapping](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wrapping/Fabric%20Gift%20Wraping_-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Technique 3: Hard to Wrap Gifts\nThis final technique is great for hard to wrap items, like cylindrical shaped gourmet foods!\n\nFirst cut a piece of fabric that is about 2\" wider than the height of the box, that is also the circumference of the box (or depending on the fabric you choose, you might want to double the fabric up!). \n\nPlace your gift in the top center of the fabric and roll. Tie off each end with ribbon and you are done!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Wrapping](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Wrapping/Untitled%20Catalog17734.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy these quick and easy ways to wrap your gifts in fabric this holiday season and beyond!",

The cozy flannel backing is festive and warm.  Choose your favorite linen color and flannel print and make up a few of these quilts as handmade holiday gifts!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6045-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Instructions\nThis easy quilt top goes together in strips.  First you'll need to cut the fabric for the quilt top.\n\n#####Cutting the Essex Linen:\nFirst, cut seven 7.5in x WOF strips from the Essex linen.\nTrim five of these strips to 42in.\nFrom the remaining two strips, cut five 7.5in x 10in strips.\n\nJoin together a 42in strip with a 10in strip using a 1/4in seam allowance and a smaller stitch length.  Repeat for all five strips. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6060-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n#####Cutting the White Fabric:\nNext, cut five 7.5in x WOF strips from the Kona Cotton white.\nTrim four of these strips to 42in.\nFrom the remaining strip cut four 7.5in x 10in pieces.\n\nJoin together a 42in strip with a 10in strip using a 1/4in seam allowance.  Repeat for all four strips.\n\n####Assemble the quilt top\n\nSew the strips together lengthwise using a 1/4in seam allowance. Start with a linen strip then a white strip, then a linen strip…etc.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6061-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin liberally during this step.  While sewing straight strips together is simple, they will warp if you are not careful.  \n\nAnother trick to prevent warping is to sew each strip on in the opposite direction as the one before it.  By flipping the quilt top in each direction the stripes will be straighter.\n\n\n\n####Tips for working with linen\n\nUse a smaller stitch length when working with linen.  Linen has a looser weave so the smaller stitch length will help it hold up better.  \n\nLinen also has a tendency to stretch a bit so handle it carefully and consider using starch. \n\nFind more tips and tricks for successfully sewing with linen in <a href=\"https://www.quiltylove.com/quilting-essex-linen-fabric/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.   \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_striped_quilt_tutorial--min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n\nThere you have it!  Your super simple striped quilt top is done.\n\n####Prepare the backing fabric\n\nYou are now ready to prepare the backing flannel fabric for your quilt.  Cut the flannel backing in half on the short side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_striped_quilt_tutorial-15-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTrim the selvedge off the two sides you will join together.  Sew the two pieces back together on the long sides using a 1/2in seam allowance.  Press this seam.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_striped_quilt_tutorial-14-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Baste the quilt\n\nNext baste your quilt by placing the backing flannel piece right side down, adding the batting and placing the quilt top right side up.  Pin or spray baste in place.  \n\n####Quilting\n\nQuilt by outlining each seam using a walking foot.  Add accent lines as desired.  I added 2 more lines outside of each seam spaced 1/2in apart.  I also added 3 1/2in spaced lines right down the center of each strip.  \n\n####Bind the quilt\n\nFrom your binding fabric, cut six 2.5in x WOF strips.  Sew them together end to end.  Fold your binding wrong sides together lengthwise and press.   Attach the binding to the quilt.  <a href=\"https://www.quiltylove.com/machine-bind-quilt-beginner-friendly-method/\" target=\"_blank\">Follow this easy binding tutorial here. </a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6063-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew up a few of these striped flannel quilts to have on hand this holiday season.  You will want to keep one for yourself after you see how cozy these quilts are!  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6094-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Winter Blankets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Winter%20Blanket/quiltylove_EmilyDennis-6118-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Secure with pearlhead pins discretely within the folds of the petals, and visibly in the center for a dimensional floral look.

This robe is a Misses' adult small.\n* General sewing supplies\n\nWe chose <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/minky-cloud-spa-cuddle\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Spa Cuddle®</a> fabric because it has a double-sided, ultra-plush textured surface that feels great on both sides (which is very important for a robe!).

To control this, after cutting remove from your cutting surface and place in the dryer with a damp washcloth on low heat for ~10 minutes. \n* For less shedding, use a scalpel-style seam ripper. Use along the edge of your ruler or draw the cutting line along the wrong side first. Cut from the wrong side, then pull apart gently.\n\n####Sewing Tips\n* Sew using at least a 3mm stitch length and a lighter tension. \n* Use a 90/14 Stretch Needle. \n* Be aware of nap, grain and stretch. Stitch stretchy sides together and non-stretchy sides together. \n* Pin fabrics together well and sew slowly. Flat flower head pins are best because they are easy to see in the thickness of Cuddle®. Sewing fast will cause upper fabric to stretch. \n* Use a Walking Foot or Even Feed Foot to prevent pleating and shifting of fabric.\n* Engage the “needle down” feature on your machine. If you do not have this feature, turn the wheel on the right side of your machine to put the needle in the fabric when you stop to adjust the fabric, and continue stitching.\n* Make sure that your presser foot tension is not too tight. This can cause the fabric to not feed through the machine evenly. Check your machine’s manual to learn how you can adjust it.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Spa Robe](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Giftable%20Spa%20Robe/2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n",

To view all 12 of our holiday projects, from DIY decor to giftable projects, click <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-12-days-of-projects\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nThis scarf is a quick project to keep you warm all winter, or makes a lovely handmade gift! The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/shannon-luxe-cuddle\" target=\"_blank\">Minky Luxe Cuddle® Collection</a> from Shannon Fabrics has a wonderful variety of textures, colors, and longer pile lengths that are perfect for this infinity scarf. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKQ2oU0kiVY\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Supplies:\n* 2 yds. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/shannon-luxe-cuddle\" target=\"_blank\">Minky Luxe Cuddle®</a> \n* General sewing supplies\n\n####Step 1\nCut Minky fabric into a 59” x 24.5” rectangle. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Infinity Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Infinity%20Scarf/minky%20measurements-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe 59” measurement is along the selvedge to complement the vertical nap of the minky texture. This cutting suggestion requires 2 yards of minky and will yield 2 scarfs (one to keep, one to give!). It is possible to cut this rectangle with the 24.5” on the selvedge and the 59” across the width, which would require only 1 yard of minky. Keep the orientation of fabric in mind when determining how many yards to purchase. \n\n####Step 2\nFold right sides together, and sew the 59” side seams with a ½” seam allowance. Once the side seam is complete, flip inside out.\n\n*Tip: Use a walking foot in your sewing machine. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Infinity Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Infinity%20Scarf/side%20seam%20tube-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nJoin one side of the ends to the opposite end, but before you do, twist it! Twisting it before joining the ends allows the scarf to have a more flattering fit around the neck when worn!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Infinity Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Infinity%20Scarf/twist%20sequence-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nUse pins or wonder clips to join one side of the tube opening to the other, right sides together. Sew ½” seam along the tube opening until you should have about a 6” opening. The scarf should be almost completely right side out at this point, and you can <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-101-hand-slip-stitch/\" target=\"_blank\">hand stitch</a> the opening closed. It’s best to join the tube this way so that the scarf infinity tube can freely move, creating a better fit. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Infinity Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Infinity%20Scarf/pin%20scarf-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTo wear, double it around your neck to create a soft and cozy cowl around your neck, pairing perfectly with any coat or jacket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Infinity Scarf](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIY%20Infinity%20Scarf/shannon%20wearing%20it-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThis same tutorial can be used with many apparel fabrics.

To view all 12 of our holiday projects, from DIY decor to giftable projects, click <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-12-days-of-projects\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nToday we’re sharing a tutorial to line a simple basket with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>, using just a glue gun! This fabric requires no sewing, and is perfect for when you’re in a crunch for time but still want to create a really special gift.\n\nYou might have a basket lying around at home that could use a little make over as well! So, check to see if you have one at home hiding in a closet or tucked away in the garage. If no basket is to be found at home there are a lot of places you can buy them used for a few dollars. \n\nLet’s get started!\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0018.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Supplies needed\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric</a> of your choice for basket lining (we used an assortment of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/riley-blake-pixie-noel\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Pixie Noel</a> fabrics) \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=batting\" target=\"_blank\">Batting</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?brands-and-designers=the-warm-company&product-type=batting\" target=\"_blank\">Warm & Natural</a> batting, but polyester batting is good too) \n* Measuring tape\n* Pencil\n* Fabric scissors\n* Paper scissors\n* Glue gun and extra glue sticks\n* Cardboard or paper\n* Optional: pinking shears and ribbon\n\nHere is the basket before adding the liner. We used a set of baskets in two different sizes. You can use any shape or size, and it’s super easy to customize the fabric liner!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0001.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Instructions\nMeasure the basket circumference. Multiply the circumference by 1.5. That is the length of fabric you will need to line the side of the basket because we will be ruching the fabric as we’re gluing it on. If you want more ruching, double the circumference and cut the fabric to that length (i.e. 20” circumference x1.5= 30” long strip of fabric).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0009.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNext, measure the height of the basket inside. Add 3” to the basket height (i.e. 4” high basket side + 3”= 7”).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0006.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut the fabric strip according to the width and height totals figured out in steps 1 and 2. \n\n\nTrace the basket bottom onto the cardboard. It doesn't have to be an exact trace, just make sure to get general shape of the basket. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0010.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0013.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut it out. Since we traced the outside of the basket, the cardboard will not fit inside the basket bottom. Trim the cardboard down little by little to fit inside the basket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0014.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0015.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0016.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTake two layers of batting and cut to fit the cardboard for the basket bottom. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0020.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nTake your glue gun and glue on the batting to the cardboard. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0021.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut one layer of batting strip to fit the basket circumference. Glue the inside of the basket, about an inch below the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0027.jpg)\n</p>\n\nAttach the batting strip and go around the whole basket. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0028.jpg)\n</p>\n\nJust work on a few inches at a time since the glue hardens fast and you need to attach the batting while the glue is still hot.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0029.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nNow that the batting is glued on to the inside of the basket side, it’s time for the fabric strip to be glued on!\n\nStart by applying some glue above the batting and attach the fabric strip. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0030.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce the strip is on, you will do the ruching by squishing it over the the side. Glue, attach and do the ruching as you go around the whole basket. If you find that you need to use more than one strip of fabric, just overlap the fabric pieces where they meet and continue to work your way around. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0031.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0032.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0033.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow take your basket bottom that you glued the batting onto and place it on top of a piece of fabric . Place the fabric wrong side up, and the basket bottom with the batting side down. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0023.jpg)\n</p>\n\nCut the fabric and leave enough to glue onto the cardboard bottom. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0024.jpg)\n</p>\n\nApply glue to the edge of the cardboard and attach the fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0026.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the bottom piece right side up and place it inside the basket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0034.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0035.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow that your basket is done, fill it up with goodies! We made a gift basket full of embroidery supplies for an aspiring embroiderer. Embroidery hoops, floss, and pattern tracing materials. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0038.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0040.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHere are both of the baskets, and now we have just have to fill the smaller one to gift!\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0043.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0044.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0048.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe jar covers are super easy to make as well, just trace a circle using a jar or small plate and cut out with pinking shears. Then tie them up with a ribbon!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric Gift Baskets](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20Bakset/2017-10-31_0053.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy holiday sewing!\n\n\n",

To view all 12 of our holiday projects, from DIY decor to giftable projects, click <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/creativity-headquarters-12-days-of-projects\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n  \nSewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequins</a> is easier than you think! Although a few extra steps are required, the results are worth it!

Use a press cloth with a low heat setting when needed.\n\n####Mermaid Sequins\nThis unique sequin fabric is so much fun. The density of the 2-faced sequins creates movement and dimension. But with so many sequins, they will inevitably be cut and sewn – which requires some extra attention when creating seams. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0512722.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/mermaid%20seam-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n\n#####Tip 1\nPull off any loose sequins, and shift all the sequins away from the edge. \n\n#####Tip 2\nBind the seam with tulle or tricot. Sew the desired seam allowance, but add a strip of tulle to the seam as you sew. Once the seam is sewn, wrap the seam with remaining width of the strip and zig zag stitch to secure onto the seam allowance. Then, hand whip stitch the seam flat. The results are a stable flat seam, with no scratchy sequins or cut edges poking through. \n\n####Embroidered Sequins\nVery commonly, sequins will be sewn in a sporadic embroidered design onto a woven fabric, such as satin or taffeta. For apparel, this type of fabric requires a lining anyways, so the comfort of the seam is less important. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0512245.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/pink%20sequin%20seam-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Tip\nBe sure to sew with a ½” to 5/8” seam allowance, and press open the seam allowance with a low-heat iron setting and a press-cloth. The seam will lie nicely, the sequins are small enough to not cause too much commotion when cut or sewn within a seam. \n\n####Large or irregular shaped sequins\nLarger sequins, or irregular shaped sequins, can create seams that might warrant a liability waiver if not sewn properly. When cut or sewn into a seam, they can protrude out, causing sharp edges and immovable sequins.\n\nPrepping this type of sequin fabric for sewing is the most labor intensive, but yields the best results!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0530576-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/gold%20sequin%20seam-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Tip 1\nRemove sequins from the desired seam allowance. It’s best to clear ½” – 5/8” for a 3/8” seam allowance. You can always cut down the seam allowance later if needed.\n\nRemoving each sequin?!? That will take forever! Fear not – there’s a tip for that...\n\n#####Tip 2\nIf the sequins are uniformly sewn in rows on lengthwise grain – you are in luck. On the back, with a seam ripper, find the fine threads that form these sequins rows. Use your seam ripper to gently undo those threads and gently pull them… 1 - 2 backing threads should be available to pull out. Flip to the front, locate the sequin at the top of the row and then pull…. The whole row of sequins should pop off the front. \n\nVoila! \n\nNote: Sequins that are applied in rows will have a machine-like grouping, so one set of rows may only go for 12- 14” and then the next group of rows starts. The method in step 2 will only work per grouping, so stop at the groupings’ intersections to repeat the process.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/sequin%20groupings-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n#####Tip 3\nFor removing sequins around curves or the crosswise grain, you will have to remove the sequins individually. It actually goes by quicker than you think.\n\n#####Tip 4\nUse tape! Gently maneuver the sequins away from the newly-bare edge and use 3”- 4” strips of tape to secure them out of the way temporarily. The less sticky the tape the better – to dull the tape, just apply and remove it on your clothes once or twice before applying to the sequins. Trust us, this will help so much when the tape has to be removed.\n\n#####Tip 5\nUse a walking foot. Once the sequins are removed, what’s left is a very lightweight, sheer, stretchy mesh fabric. Sew that as you would normally, with 2mm length stitches and a size 75/11 universal ball point needle.\n\nOnce your seam is done, you can remove the tape and shape the sequins back into place. The seam is free of any poky sequins, sharp edges, pleasant to touch and almost completely unnoticeable.\nNote: We are aware that you are human, and catching the occasional sequin in the seam is inevitable despite your best efforts. And that’s ok! There’s a tip for that...\n\n#####Tip 6\nUse snips to carefully cut the sequin out of the seam. Since the sequin is larger, you can give it a little shapely trim so it looks similar to its friends, and push the cut sequin remnant into the seam, and maneuver it out on the underside of the seam with tweezers. This tip is performed in Step 6 of the Clutch Tutorial below.\n\n####Stabilizing mesh backed sequin fabric\nSequin fabric comes in a lovely variety of weights, designs and backings. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">Mesh-based sequin fabric</a> usually has a bit of stretch and drape, so stabilizing this type of sequin fabric is great for accessories, crafts and home décor.\n\n#####Tip 1\nUse <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293641/heatn-bond-3521-lite-iron-on-adhesive-17\" target=\"_blank\">Heat n’ Bond Lite</a> to fuse the sequins onto the desired backing. In the example shown, we’ve taken the stretchiest, drapiest sequin mesh fabric with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tear-drop-sequins-and-mesh\" target=\"_blank\">teardrop-shaped sequins</a> and fused it to sturdy <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/double-sided-quilted-cotton-broadcloth\" target=\"_blank\">double-sided quilted broadcloth</a> in a similar shade to create a study, stable piece of sequin fabric.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293641/heatn-bond-3521-lite-iron-on-adhesive-17\" target=\"_blank\">Heat n’ Bond Lite</a> allows for 2 fabrics to be fused together.\n\nFollow the directions on the Heat n’ Bond packaging, but lower the iron setting to mid, and use a press cloth so the sequins or mesh doesn’t melt.\n\nNote: If using mesh backed fabric with small or regular sized sequins, like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/glitz-sequin-mesh\" target=\"_blank\">this fabric</a>, it is not necessary to remove the sequins from the seam allowance edge to fuse it to another fabric. This example shows that because the sequins on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530576/tear-drop-sequins-mesh-blush\" target=\"_blank\">this fabric</a> are larger and irregular shaped.\n\n#####Tip 2\nWhen ironing on the Heat N’ Bond, test on scrap fabrics first! This will help you to gauge how much pressing and how long to press is required. \n\nWe loved <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530576/tear-drop-sequins-mesh-blush\" target=\"_blank\">this tear drop sequin fabric</a> so much, that if stabilized we knew it would be an amazing clutch bag for holiday and special occasions. Let’s make it now!\n\n####Clutch Bag Tutorial\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/sequin%20clutch-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis clutch bag features a double-slider zipper closure, and a clean finish lining. This project is fun, easy and you’ll love the results!\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/supply%20shot-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Supplies Needed and Cutting Instructions\nCut (2) 13 ½” x 14” pieces of each:\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530576/tear-drop-sequins-mesh-blush\" target=\"_blank\">Tear Drop Sequins & Mesh Blush</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0269127/double-sided-quilted-broadcloth-peach\" target=\"_blank\">Double Sided Quilted Broadcloth Peach </a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293641/heatn-bond-3521-lite-iron-on-adhesive-17\" target=\"_blank\">Heat N’ Bond Lite</a> \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0518520/art-gallery-blush-hex-rose\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Blush Hex Rose</a> \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-896/dogwood-purse-double-slider-zipper-12\" target=\"_blank\">Dogwood Purse Double Slider Zipper 12\"</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-498/pellon-70-peltex-sew-in-ultra-firm-stabilizer\" target=\"_blank\">70 Peltex Ultra Firm Sew-In Stabilizer</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0339410/pellon-deco-fuse-firm-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon 520 Deco Fuse</a>\n\n####Step 1: Prepping the sequin pieces\nReferencing the above sewing tips for sequins and the video, prep the sequin fabric by removing the sequins ½” around the edges and fuse it to double-sided quilted broadcloth. Then tape the edges to secure the sequins away from the edges. This is sewn with 3/8” seam allowance and ¼” seam allowance for the zipper application. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/Step%201%20prepped%20clutch%20pieces-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 2\nSew the double-slider purse zipper to the top 13½\" edges. A zipper foot is optional here, or you can use the far left position setting with a regular presser-foot. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/Step%202%20zipper%20clipped-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/Step%202%20-%20zipper%20machine%20sewing-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTip: As you sew the zipper, slide the zipper pull out of the way, so it doesn’t shift your straight stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%202%20zipper%20sewn-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/Step%202%20zipper%20sewn%20on%20sequin%20pieces-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nSew the top edges of the lining fabric to the zipper. Fold the lining back, and top stitch. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%203%20clip%20lining-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%203%20top%20stitch%20zipper%20lining.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nPinching the zipper ends out of the way, sew the lining right sides together, leaving at least an 11” opening at the bottom.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%204%20sew%20lining-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOpen the zipper slides at least 10” before you sew the sequin pieces together. This is key to be able to easily flip right side out in Step 6.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%204%20open%20the%20zipper-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5\nRight sides together, sew the sequin pieces together carefully. Be very aware of your seam as you sew to not catch any taped-off sequins. If you catch a few, it’s ok!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%205%20done-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nClip corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%205%20clip%20corners-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6\nFlip the bag rightside out and remove the tape. Don’t pull on the tape as it will pull the sequins. Peel back the tape carefully, loosening the sequins with your nail or seam ripper as you go. If any sequins are stuck in the seam, use your snips to carefully cut them out, give the sequin a shapely trim, and push any remaining cut sequin parts into the seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%206%20flip%20it-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%206%20peel%20off%20tape-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%206%20sequin%20fix-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 7\nTo stabilize the bag, cut 2 pieces of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0339410/pellon-deco-fuse-firm-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon 520 Deco Fuse</a>. \n\n* 12 ½” x 6 ½”\n* 12 ½” x 7”\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%207%20deco%20fuse%20dimensions-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe 6 ½” tall piece will be fused to the backside of the front piece of the clutch, and the 7” tall piece will be fused to the back, the difference in height will enable the clutch to fold over properly and consistently.\n\n####Step 8\nInsert a Deco-Fuse piece, fusible side down, through the opening of the lining, onto the double sided quilt fabric. This takes some maneuvering. Push the piece down as far as it will go, lying flat on the quilted fabric and not overlapping any side seams. Following the directions for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0339410/pellon-deco-fuse-firm-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">520 Deco-Fuse</a>, take your iron inside the opening of the lining, inside the bag, and iron to fuse the stabilizer. Repeat for front side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%208%20insert%20deco%20fuse-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%208%20deco%20fuse%20in%20clutch-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTip: Iron the bulk of the deco-fuse first and let cool, then hit the missed edges and corners. \n\nIf your iron is larger, this might not be possible. But fear not! There is another way: Use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-449/fabri-tac-adhesive-glue\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric-Tac</a> with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-498/pellon-70-peltex-sew-in-ultra-firm-stabilizer\" target=\"_blank\">70 Peltex Ultra Firm Sew-In Stabilizer</a> instead <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0339410/pellon-deco-fuse-firm-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Deco-Fuse</a>.\n\nNote: Fabri-Tac and 70 Peltex is also recommended for faux leather or vinyl fabrics since they cannot be ironed. The sequin fabric can handle the heat from the iron because the double sided quilted fabric backing serves as a barrier to the heat. \n\n####Step 9\nTop stitch the lining opening closed, tuck inside, you should have a square shaped bag. Fold the bag towards the front, where the 12 ½” x 6 ½” stabilizer piece was applied.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%209%20top%20stitch%20lining-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/step%209%20inside%20clutch-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sequins](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/clutch%20square-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Other Fabric Options\nNot into the glitz and glam of a sequin clutch?

Use a press cloth with a low heat setting when needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"mermaidsequins\">Mermaid Sequins</h4>\n\n<p>This unique sequin fabric is so much fun. The density of the 2-faced sequins creates movement and dimension. But with so many sequins, they will inevitably be cut and sewn – which requires some extra attention when creating seams. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0512722.jpg\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/mermaid%20seam-min.JPG\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip1\">Tip 1</h5>\n\n<p>Pull off any loose sequins, and shift all the sequins away from the edge. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip2\">Tip 2</h5>\n\n<p>Bind the seam with tulle or tricot. Sew the desired seam allowance, but add a strip of tulle to the seam as you sew. Once the seam is sewn, wrap the seam with remaining width of the strip and zig zag stitch to secure onto the seam allowance. Then, hand whip stitch the seam flat. The results are a stable flat seam, with no scratchy sequins or cut edges poking through. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"embroideredsequins\">Embroidered Sequins</h4>\n\n<p>Very commonly, sequins will be sewn in a sporadic embroidered design onto a woven fabric, such as satin or taffeta. For apparel, this type of fabric requires a lining anyways, so the comfort of the seam is less important. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0512245.jpg\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/pink%20sequin%20seam-min.JPG\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip\">Tip</h5>\n\n<p>Be sure to sew with a ½” to 5/8” seam allowance, and press open the seam allowance with a low-heat iron setting and a press-cloth. The seam will lie nicely, the sequins are small enough to not cause too much commotion when cut or sewn within a seam. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"largeorirregularshapedsequins\">Large or irregular shaped sequins</h4>\n\n<p>Larger sequins, or irregular shaped sequins, can create seams that might warrant a liability waiver if not sewn properly. When cut or sewn into a seam, they can protrude out, causing sharp edges and immovable sequins.</p>\n\n<p>Prepping this type of sequin fabric for sewing is the most labor intensive, but yields the best results!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/0530576-min.jpg\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/gold%20sequin%20seam-min.JPG\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip1\">Tip 1</h5>\n\n<p>Remove sequins from the desired seam allowance. It’s best to clear ½” – 5/8” for a 3/8” seam allowance. You can always cut down the seam allowance later if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Removing each sequin?!? That will take forever! Fear not – there’s a tip for that...</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip2\">Tip 2</h5>\n\n<p>If the sequins are uniformly sewn in rows on lengthwise grain – you are in luck. On the back, with a seam ripper, find the fine threads that form these sequins rows. Use your seam ripper to gently undo those threads and gently pull them… 1 - 2 backing threads should be available to pull out. Flip to the front, locate the sequin at the top of the row and then pull…. The whole row of sequins should pop off the front. </p>\n\n<p>Voila! </p>\n\n<p>Note: Sequins that are applied in rows will have a machine-like grouping, so one set of rows may only go for 12- 14” and then the next group of rows starts. The method in step 2 will only work per grouping, so stop at the groupings’ intersections to repeat the process.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20with%20Sequins/sequin%20groupings-min.jpg\" alt=\"Sequins\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip3\">Tip 3</h5>\n\n<p>For removing sequins around curves or the crosswise grain, you will have to remove the sequins individually. It actually goes by quicker than you think.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip4\">Tip 4</h5>\n\n<p>Use tape! Gently maneuver the sequins away from the newly-bare edge and use 3”- 4” strips of tape to secure them out of the way temporarily. The less sticky the tape the better – to dull the tape, just apply and remove it on your clothes once or twice before applying to the sequins. Trust us, this will help so much when the tape has to be removed.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip5\">Tip 5</h5>\n\n<p>Use a walking foot. Once the sequins are removed, what’s left is a very lightweight, sheer, stretchy mesh fabric. Sew that as you would normally, with 2mm length stitches and a size 75/11 universal ball point needle.</p>\n\n<p>Once your seam is done, you can remove the tape and shape the sequins back into place. The seam is free of any poky sequins, sharp edges, pleasant to touch and almost completely unnoticeable. <br />\nNote: We are aware that you are human, and catching the occasional sequin in the seam is inevitable despite your best efforts. And that’s ok! There’s a tip for that...</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip6\">Tip 6</h5>\n\n<p>Use snips to carefully cut the sequin out of the seam. Since the sequin is larger, you can give it a little shapely trim so it looks similar to its friends, and push the cut sequin remnant into the seam, and maneuver it out on the underside of the seam with tweezers. This tip is performed in Step 6 of the Clutch Tutorial below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"stabilizingmeshbackedsequinfabric\">Stabilizing mesh backed sequin fabric</h4>\n\n<p>Sequin fabric comes in a lovely variety of weights, designs and backings. <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">Mesh-based sequin fabric</a> usually has a bit of stretch and drape, so stabilizing this type of sequin fabric is great for accessories, crafts and home décor.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip1\">Tip 1</h5>\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293641/heatn-bond-3521-lite-iron-on-adhesive-17\" target=\"_blank\">Heat n’ Bond Lite</a> to fuse the sequins onto the desired backing. In the example shown, we’ve taken the stretchiest, drapiest sequin mesh fabric with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/tear-drop-sequins-and-mesh\" target=\"_blank\">teardrop-shaped sequins</a> and fused it to sturdy <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/double-sided-quilted-cotton-broadcloth\" target=\"_blank\">double-sided quilted broadcloth</a> in a similar shade to create a study, stable piece of sequin fabric.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0293641/heatn-bond-3521-lite-iron-on-adhesive-17\" target=\"_blank\">Heat n’ Bond Lite</a> allows for 2 fabrics to be fused together.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the directions on the Heat n’ Bond packaging, but lower the iron setting to mid, and use a press cloth so the sequins or mesh doesn’t melt.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If using mesh backed fabric with small or regular sized sequins, like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/glitz-sequin-mesh\" target=\"_blank\">this fabric</a>, it is not necessary to remove the sequins from the seam allowance edge to fuse it to another fabric. This example shows that because the sequins on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530576/tear-drop-sequins-mesh-blush\" target=\"_blank\">this fabric</a> are larger and irregular shaped.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"tip2\">Tip 2</h5>\n\n<p>When ironing on the Heat N’ Bond, test on scrap fabrics first! This will help you to gauge how much pressing and how long to press is required. </p>\n\n<p>We loved <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530576/tear-drop-sequins-mesh-blush\" target=\"_blank\">this tear drop sequin fabric</a> so much, that if stabilized we knew it would be an amazing clutch bag for holiday and special occasions.

But fear not! There is another way: Use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-449/fabri-tac-adhesive-glue\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric-Tac</a> with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-498/pellon-70-peltex-sew-in-ultra-firm-stabilizer\" target=\"_blank\">70 Peltex Ultra Firm Sew-In Stabilizer</a> instead <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0339410/pellon-deco-fuse-firm-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Deco-Fuse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Fabri-Tac and 70 Peltex is also recommended for faux leather or vinyl fabrics since they cannot be ironed. The sequin fabric can handle the heat from the iron because the double sided quilted fabric backing serves as a barrier to the heat. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step9\">Step 9</h4>\n\n<p>Top stitch the lining opening closed, tuck inside, you should have a square shaped bag.

There’s no better season for everything glitzy and special – we basically have a free pass to wear all the shimmer and shine we want! And what’s the holiday season without a little sparkle? Not complete, if you ask me. I’ve always liked making a few <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequin</a> garments in December, and I like to encourage other sewists to do the same.

It’s a very easy <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequin</a> fabric to work with, and it’s available in a lot of different colors. (That red is especially gorgeous!) \n\nLooking for sewing tips for working with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequins</a>? Click <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-101-sewing-with-sequins-2/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to view our blog post and video! Whether you are new to working with sequin fabric, or have been sewing for years, these helpful tips and tricks are a great reference!.\n\n####Pattern Choices\nFor these NYE looks, I chose simple patterns with no darts or zippers or buttons and only a few seams. It’s a good idea to avoid over-complicated designs when working with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequin</a> fabric, and everything you would normally anticipate when you undertake a sewing project (seam finishes, hems, facings, closures, etc.) is even more important to plan fabrics like this. \n\nFor unlined garments like these two, bias tape around the seams and hems is a great alternative to serging, which is a huge no-no for sequin material. For the top, I attached bias tape to each edge (neckline, arms, and hem) and then turned the seam under and hand stitched it down. This fabric isn’t at all scratchy on the wrong side, so you can absolutely choose patterns that have no lining. By the same token, garments that are lined would be great options too. For the top I used <a href=\"https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m6566\" target=\"_blank\">McCall's 6566</a>, and for the skirt I used <a href=\"https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m5430\" target=\"_blank\">McCall’s 5430</a> (lengthened).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric16-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric15-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI used the same technique for the skirt and, just like the top, it makes for clean edges with no loose sequins or unfinished seams. For additional stability for the ties and waistband, I placed the sequin fabric on top of an underlining that had been interfaced. And in place of a button and buttonhole like the pattern suggests, I used snaps.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric9-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric13-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric14-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe biggest thing to remember when you work with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?product-features=sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequin</a> fabric is that it is the star of the show. Any design with too many bells and whistles will only make things crowded and distracting. Instead, go with a pattern that is more simple to let the fabric really shine. It’s also important to be patient and take it a little slower with these kinds of fabrics. And I always wear safety glasses when I cut out my garment. Cut sequins go rogue all the time, and you want to protect those peepers!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric17-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DIYs for NYE](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DIYs%20for%20NYE/Fabric11-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThere’s still plenty of time to whip up something pretty in time for New Year’s Eve and, gosh, if you aren’t wearing sparkle on New Year’s Eve are you really doing it right?\n\nHappy sewing!\n",

Whether you have some New Year's resolutions to fulfill, or just enjoy some comfy clothes, the newest athletic knits from  <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=pine-crest-fabrics&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\">Pine Crest Fabrics</a> will be perfect for your project from lounging to lunging!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4082-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI'm working on my goal to get some regular exercise into my routine, because sewing isn't the most aerobic activity out there- ha!  To stay motivated, I know I need some fun new gear, and knew that a fun pair of leggings and long-sleeved tunic could get me through this cold season. \n\n####Fabric Choices\nThe following fabrics were pulled to keep me (hopefully) on task!\n\nFirst is the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0539028/pine-crest-fabrics-strata-athletic-knit-white-grey-black\">Pine Crest Fabrics Strata Athletic Knit White/Grey/Black</a>. This is a perfect neutral with the trademark space-dyed athleisure print you see out in the market.  This print is great at hiding up sweat marks you might see in just a solid but remains a perfect staple.  The fabric feels so smooth and luxurious with an amazing 30% four-way stretch!\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4103-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nThen I went for a more wild print for my leggings! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0540376/pine-crest-fabrics-jungle-leaves-on-olympus-athletic-double-knit-green\">Pine Crest Fabrics Jungle Leaves on Olympus Athletic Double Knit Green</a> </span> is a gorgeous on-trend print to add some fun to the mundane tasks of working out!   Although this is a large scale print being used on a skin-tight garment, the different colors and shades really make the eye move around, creating a very flattering effect.

This reduces the friction of seams against your skin, as well as having some additional stretch in your stitching.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4098-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* Relieve the pressure on your presser foot (if it's an option on your machine.)  This will allow the fabric to move more evenly and not be stretched out in the process.\n* Use a scrap piece of \"leader\" fabric to help with guide your thicker seams through your machine (this helps prevent your machine from \"eating\" up your precious project).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4097-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* If you have the option, use a triple zig-zag stitch on your domestic (much more strength and stretch than your basic zig-zag.)\n* Use a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-939/sulky-paper-solvy-water-soluble-stabilizer\">wash-away</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0539102/sulky-tear-easy-stabilizer-white-12-x-11-yd-roll\">tear-away stabilizer</a> to help the fabric move through your machine. (Although, I will use tissue paper in a pinch.)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4093-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* Stabilize shoulder seams and any other high stress-points with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3102/fusiknit-tricot-fusible-interfacing-white?cm_vc=756b1813-cbc1-43b3-84bd-29889bf8fb7b\">knit interfacing</a>  or clear elastic.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4100-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* Leave at least a few inches on every thread tail as you move through your project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Athleisure](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Athleisure%20Jan%202018/IMG_4095-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* Most importantly, test every. single. seam. with all your strength.  Test out your stitches on scraps and see if any pop.  Adjust as needed.  After every seam sewn, pull horizontally and vertically.  Your bobbin or looper threads may shift and that's okay...you just added more easement into your stitches and that's why you have those thread tails!\n* Backstitch at the beginning and end of each seam AFTER the stress tests.  If you are serging, either use a large-eye needle to pull the tail back into the stitching or loop it into an adjoining seam.\n\nHome-sewn athletic wear is very possible and I hope these tips help you through your next project.

I have a super fun wall pocket tutorial for you today, because I don’t know about you, but with the New Year I always feel the need to move stuff around and re-organize things around the house. That’s when a wall pocket organizer such as this one will come in handy for all those little bits and pieces you’ve got laying around. I have a sewing space that always needs a bit of organizing and I knew this would be the solution to my organizing needs. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0002.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Materials needed\n*Finished size: Approximately 21” wide x 36” tall\n\nI chose an assortment of prints from the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-sienna\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Sienna Collection</a> for my organizer, but the possibilities are endless with fabric.com's selection!\n\t\t\n#####Main panel:\n* 3/4 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for main panel front\n* 3/4 yard <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for main panel back\n* 21” x 36” piece of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/byannie\" target=\"_blank\">ByAnnie’s Soft and Stable</a>\n\t\n#####Pocket panels:\n* 1/2 yard of each of the four <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/cotton-and-steel-sienna\n\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Sienna</a> prints featured in the project\n* 1 3/4 yards <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-3103/pellon-sf101-shape-flex-woven-fusible-interfacing-white\" target=\"_blank\">Pellon SF 101</a>\n\t\n#####Binding:\n* (5) strips 2.5” x WOF\n\n*Notes: Use a 1/2” seam allowance throughout unless otherwise noted. Width of fabric (WOF) is assumed to be 42”.\n\t\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0028.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Tools needed \n* Ruler\n* Rotary cutter\n* Hera marker \n* Binding clips\n* Pins\n* Disappearing fabric marker/pen \n* Glue basting spray ( I used 505 Spray and Fix by Odif )\n* Walking foot for your sewing machine\n\nFinally, you'll need a set of curtain clips for hanging!\n\n####Step 1\nCut out your fabric and Pellon SF 101 pieces according to the chart below. \n\t\n#####Main panel front and back:\n* 22” wide x 37” tall ( you’re cutting these pieces slightly bigger than the soft and stable because when you quilt you lose some of the width and height of the fabric )\n\t\n#####Main panel soft and stable: \n* 21” wide x 36” tall \n\t\n#####Top row pockets: \n* (4) 9” wide x 7” tall pieces of each fabric as seen on the wall pocket organizer\n* (1) 33” wide x 7” tall piece of Pellon SF 101\n\t\n#####Second row pockets:\n* (4) 9” wide x 7” tall pieces of each fabric as seen on the wall pocket organizer\n* (4) 9” wide x 7” tall pieces of Pellon SF 101\n* (1) 33” wide x 7” tall piece of lining \n\n#####Third row pockets: \n* (1) 11” wide x 8” tall piece of fabric for the center pocket \n* (2) 10” wide x 8” tall pieces of fabric for the left and right side pockets \n* (1) 11” wide x 8” tall piece of Pellon SF 101\n* (2) 10” wide x 8” tall pieces of Pellon SF 101\n* (1) 29” wide x 8” tall piece of lining \n\n#####Fourth row pockets: \n* (2) 14” wide x 9” tall pieces of each fabric as seen on the wall pocket organizer\n* (2) 14” wide x 9” tall pieces of Pellon SF 101\n* (1) 27” wide x 9” tall piece of lining \n\n####Step 2\nPlace your main panel back facing down, Soft and stable on top, and your main panel front facing up. Glue baste the three layers together.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0029.jpg)\n</p>\n\nOnce the glue is set, quilt the three layers together by sewing straight lines one inch apart or as desired. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0030.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 3\nTake your pocket pieces and corresponding Pellon SF 101 pieces and fuse together with a hot iron by placing the pocket fabric face down and placing the Pellon with the glue side down. Iron. \n\t\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0031.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 4\nTake the pocket pieces for each row and sew them together with a 1/2” seam allowance. You will end up with four long strips. Make sure to press the seams open. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0032.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 5\nNow it’s time to mark the folding lines on your pocket panels! Take your hera marker and make crease marks 3/4” away from the seam on both sides on the front side of the fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0033.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0034.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMark 1” in from each end on the front side of the fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0035.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the pocket panel over so that the back side of the pockets are facing up, and mark the following lines. \nMake crease marks 1.5” away from the seam on both sides. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0036.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0037.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMark 1.75” in from each end on the back side of the fabric. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0038.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 6\nFollowing the crease lines made in the above step, go ahead the and fold the fabric and use binding clips to keep them in place. Finger press or use an iron to press to make sharp fold lines. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0039.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 7\nNow that your fabric has the fold lines set, it’s time to sew on the lining. Use a 1/2” seam allowance and sew along the top of the pocket panel. Press the lining over and edge stitch on the lining. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0040.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0041.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hanging Organizer](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Hanging%20Organizer/2018-01-09_0041.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress the lining back and sew 1/2” in from the top edge.

Each month we'll give you a behind the scenes peek into the inspiration behind some of our favorite designer's latest fabric collections, their personal style and even some little known fun facts. We're kicking things off with a bang with a fun Q&A from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Justina Blakeney</a>!\n\n####About Justina Blakeney\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Justina Blakeney</a> is a designer, artist, author of The New York Times best-selling book The New Bohemians and the founder of Jungalow®, a blog and brand about decorating wild! With a passion for color, pattern and plants, Justina and Jungalow® have quickly become the go-to sources for bohemian design inspiration. As one of the leading design personalities on the web, Justina has over two million followers online and has been named a top designer to follow on Instagram by Harper’s Bazaar, New York magazine and Lonny magazine.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/Headshot%20-%20JB-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nJustina's eponymous lifestyle brand, Justina Blakeney Home™, includes a wide range of lifestyle and home products including furniture, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>, case goods, rugs, pillows, wallpaper, bedding and stationery. Justina lives in Los Angeles with her husband Jason, young daughter Ida, kitty Luda and 52 houseplants.\n\n####Q&A\nIn this exclusive Q&A, we had a chance to ask Justina about the inspiration for her latest <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">fabric collection</a>, her personal style, what's coming up next and more!\n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for art and design?\nEver since I was a child I was very art and design oriented. I loved to paint, sew and collage. After studying art in college I moved to Italy and began to think about design as a way to make a living using my creative talents. I opened a small boutique for vintage and new-designer clothing and I found that after a few years, I was most excited about the finding vintage objects and furniture for the shop. It was then that I realized my passion for decor and began working on home decor projects. \n\nI originally began blogging as a way to do something creative everyday. I loved blogging right away as it was a natural way to combine so many of the things that I love including writing, photography, graphic design, crafting, styling, collaging, curating and decorating. Now, my blog is truly an extension of myself. I blog about all the things that I love--my family, my jungalow, my closet, my obsession will plants and global textiles, wild patterns, thrifted finds and bohemian dwellings.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/Fabric%20Show-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/cb-2417_0115_justinaBlakeney_answer1-min-nonumber.png)\n</p>\n\n####You teamed up with Valdese Weavers to create your line of textiles. What about Valdese made them the perfect partner for this project?\nPretty much everything! Valdese weavers weaves the fabric here in the U.S. at their mill in North Carolina so I get to visit the mill and watch the process of my yarns being dyed and my fabrics being woven. I get to work closely with their (AMAZING!) design team and add textures to my patterns that give them so much movement and life. It is a dream collaboration for me because of their wonderful team and extremely sophisticated capabilities. \n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/cb-2417_0115_justinaBlakeney_answer2-min-nonumber.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/IMG_3837-2-%20small-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/cb-2417_0115_justinaBlakeney_answer2-min-nonumber.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/IMG_3837-2-%20small-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric from your entire collection, what would it be, and why?\nOh that's so, so hard. I think right now <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/justina-blakeney-style-rainforest\" target=\"_blank\">Rainforest</a> is probably my favorite. Seeing that watercolor pattern come alive as a jaquard textile was SO much fun. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/IMG_8869-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in home décor?\nUm, PLANTS! Although I don't think of it as a trend--more as a staple. \n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nFor years now, my favorite thing about my job as both a designer and blogger is helping others ignite their own creativity. Seeing people use my fabrics in such creative, fun and beautiful ways really feeds my soul. \n\n####What DIY projects are on your “must make” list right now?\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/cb-2417_0115_justinaBlakeney_answer3-min-nonumber.png)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/Fabric%20Show%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?\nI look at designers like Kelly Wearstler and Jonathan Adler, and aspire to build something similar for myself -- a brand that provides both services and beautiful, well made products to the masses. My hope is to help people bring more color, pattern, plants and creativity into their lives and make their lives better (even in my small way) in the process. I also look towards brands like Tom's Shoes and Warby Parker, who have amazing 'social good' components to their businesses and I aspire to that paradigm as well.\n\n####What’s coming up for you in 2018? What’s next?\nLots more color, pattern and plants! We've just launched our first kid's collection with Pottery Barn Kids and I'm very focused on growing our online boutique (maybe there's a brick and mortar in our future too? Who knows?)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Justina%20Blakeney%20Designer%20Spotlight/fabric-lifestyle-justina-blakeney-2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?\nI love to hang out with my daughter, Ida (and my husband too!). Ida started kindergarten this year and we have a lot of fun doing arts and crafts, traveling, cooking and going on bike rides together.\n \n####Tell us one thing people might not know about you.\nI speak five languages!  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/justina-blakeney\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop Justina's full fabric collection on fabric.com!\n\n\n\n",

I’m so thankful to be back this year as a guest blogger on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>. If we haven’t ‘met’ yet, I’m Jessica. \n\nThe New Year is all about blank slates and new ventures. People makes goals, make changes, and set out to live a better life every January.  After the Christmas décor gets put away, I like to organize. I like to thin down on the things we have and get rid of things that don’t get utilized. \n\nSomething that became a focus to me last year was giving a purpose to every square inch of our home.  It’s important that your house works for you. You should love to spend time in it. We had unused corners and spaces we didn’t fully appreciate because they didn’t really do anything.  To fix this, we rethought the use of some of our rooms.  My husband and I built a small desk to fill up an empty corner in our living room, this past fall I sold everything in the entryway and built a coat rack to give more function to the space, and last spring we created built ins in the playroom for maximum storage and coziness. (Pssst those great <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">pillows</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">roman shades</a> are fabrics from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%204%20Full%20room-2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis built in area also doubled as a fantastic reading nook, and I think a cozy corner or spot in the house dedicated to relaxing and reading a good book is such a wonderful use of space. So, I created a few mood boards for DIY reading nooks to inspire you in the New Year with what I think are the perfect <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> to complement each!\n\n####The Modern Boho Book Nook\n\nFirst is a book nook with eclectic style. Now don’t let the term “nook” deter you. You can create purpose for any corner of your home. It doesn’t have to be a space secluded from others. It’s about giving a function to an area of your house. A nook for reading, coffee drinking, Pinterest browsing, or all the above really just needs a few things: good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V64NBDM/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_k4-uAbKCY0E9N\" target=\"_blank\">lighting</a>, cozy seating, throw pillows, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0767P4FGZ/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_Ke.uAbC1Y11BK\" target=\"_blank\">rug</a>, maybe some art and (of course) books! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_bohoBoard-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI’m picturing this nook in the corner of our front room. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%206-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPicture it though, keep the lamp or replace it with a cool, modern <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V64NBDM/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_k4-uAbKCY0E9N\" target=\"_blank\">sconce</a>. That’ll give you great daytime or nighttime reading light. The macramé could be switched out with a framed book sleeve or poster. There’s already a side table for holding coffee or the current reading stack (mood board table <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718Z3G9D/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_l7-uAbXR2ZAWM\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0767P4FGZ/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_Ke.uAbC1Y11BK\" target=\"_blank\">This rug</a> caught my eye. I love the warm terra cotta and orange with the blues.\n\nShop the fabrics: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ff-305/kaufman-essex-yarn-dyed-linen-blend-denim-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Chambray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0546249/justina-blakeney-geo-jacquard-mango?cm_mmc=pinterest-_-social-_-product-_-0546249\" target=\"_blank\">geometric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/ah-398/10-ounce-chenille-natural\" target=\"_blank\">chenille</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%208-min.png)\n</p>\n\nI love these textured, boho fabrics for a chair cover or curtains for more warmth, or even some comfy pillows. I, for one, wouldn’t mind spending a good amount of time in that scene. You can find a post I wrote for the fabric.com blog about how to mix and match fabrics <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/tips-for-mixing-matching-fabric-in-your-home/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n####Farmhouse Book Nook\nFor a more neutral look, here’s another board full of style and DIY projects! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_farmBoard.jpg)\n</p>\n\nUsing beautiful <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> in curtains, for throw pillows and as the pendant would give it so much texture and warmth.\n\nFor this farmhouse-inspired nook, I included my DIY embroidery hoop pendant light. Ours was large but you could choose any size and any kind of fabrics to get a very cool, very custom look. Read more about that <a href=\"https://www.househomemade.us/2016/11/embroidery-hoop-chandelier-shade.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nI also couldn’t help but add the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YD8E22/ref=twister_B009L33VP8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">leaning book shelf</a> because, as I shared with you earlier, we’ve made one of those for my desk. Buying is great but building can give you a custom size for your specific space. I also love this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clarice-Wingback-Tufted-Fabric-Accent/dp/B00P2ZPKKS/ref=sr_1_18?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1515616221&sr=1-18&keywords=upholstered+chair\" target=\"_blank\">chair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Safavieh-Adirondack-Collection-ADR108B-Oriental/dp/B00MN6NNCQ/ref=sr_1_12?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1515616527&sr=1-12&keywords=ivory+rug\" target=\"_blank\">accent rug</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Laurel-Regina-Pedestal-Accent/dp/B071W9K29F/ref=sr_1_24?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1515706765&sr=1-24&keywords=farmhouse+side+table\" target=\"_blank\">accent table</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Book-Lover-Gift-Read-Metal-Sign-Book/dp/B077VTL2DV/ref=sr_1_6?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1515706992&sr=1-6&keywords=read+sign\" target=\"_blank\">read sign</a>.\n\nShop the fabrics: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0529810/magnolia-home-fashions-berlin-ticking-stripe-black\" target=\"_blank\">Ticking stripe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408546/magnolia-home-fashions-upholstery-durango-quartz\" target=\"_blank\">herringbone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408857/premier-prints-anderson-check-french-grey\" target=\"_blank\">buffalo check</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%209%20farmhouse_preview.jpeg)\n</p>\n\n####Kiddie Fun Book Nook\nLast but not least is a fun space for the little ones! I feel like a kids space can be pulled together even easier than the others.  Here’s what I came up with for a kid’s reading nook.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_kiddieBoard-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nIsn’t that so fun?! The fabric I picked for this space makes me so happy!! First off, I love every single fabric by <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/cotton-steel\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel</a>. It’s all so whimsical and cute. In keeping with the storybook theme, I picked <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477052/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland-canvas-wonderland-metallic-navy\" target=\"_blank\">this great Alice in Wonderland fabric</a>. You could use this fabric for a pouf or sew some fluffy throw pillows for the space. I also liked <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476819/cotton-steel-kujira-star-canvas-waves-citron\" target=\"_blank\">this wavy citron fabric</a> to balance with the business of the other. Also, what better way to pull it all together than with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0554318/3-4-tianna-beaded-pom-pom-trim-multi-color\" target=\"_blank\">this colorful pom pom trim</a>….STOP IT!  You could even use that if you made your own little canopy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%2015.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nFabric.com even has a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/sb-912/sew-baby-terrific-teepees-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">teepee pattern</a> if you’d rather have something more versatile…and removable.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Reading Nook](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%2016.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor this space, we still have good lighting with the pendant. You could buy one, but I made one with a thrifted basket. Then I added in a little kitty night light, a cozy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYZMKS6/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_jn.uAb4Z11ARE\" target=\"_blank\">gender neutral rug</a>, some cute art and a playful pennant. There’s a lot of good <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0408857/premier-prints-anderson-check-french-grey\" target=\"_blank\">felt fabric</a> color options on fabric.com for creating a DIY pennant like this one.\n\nThe best and most cost efficient thing about a kids reading nook is that they can sit on the floor!

I’m so thankful to be back this year as a guest blogger on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>. If we haven’t ‘met’ yet, I’m Jessica. </p>\n\n<p>The New Year is all about blank slates and new ventures. People makes goals, make changes, and set out to live a better life every January.  After the Christmas décor gets put away, I like to organize. I like to thin down on the things we have and get rid of things that don’t get utilized. </p>\n\n<p>Something that became a focus to me last year was giving a purpose to every square inch of our home.  It’s important that your house works for you. You should love to spend time in it. We had unused corners and spaces we didn’t fully appreciate because they didn’t really do anything.  To fix this, we rethought the use of some of our rooms.  My husband and I built a small desk to fill up an empty corner in our living room, this past fall I sold everything in the entryway and built a coat rack to give more function to the space, and last spring we created built ins in the playroom for maximum storage and coziness. (Pssst those great <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">pillows</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">roman shades</a> are fabrics from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456567/cotton-steel-raindrop-cicada-song-teal\" target=\"_blank\">fabric.com</a>). </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%204%20Full%20room-2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>This built in area also doubled as a fantastic reading nook, and I think a cozy corner or spot in the house dedicated to relaxing and reading a good book is such a wonderful use of space. So, I created a few mood boards for DIY reading nooks to inspire you in the New Year with what I think are the perfect <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> to complement each!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"themodernbohobooknook\">The Modern Boho Book Nook</h4>\n\n<p>First is a book nook with eclectic style. Now don’t let the term “nook” deter you. You can create purpose for any corner of your home. It doesn’t have to be a space secluded from others. It’s about giving a function to an area of your house. A nook for reading, coffee drinking, Pinterest browsing, or all the above really just needs a few things: good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V64NBDM/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_k4-uAbKCY0E9N\" target=\"_blank\">lighting</a>, cozy seating, throw pillows, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0767P4FGZ/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_Ke.uAbC1Y11BK\" target=\"_blank\">rug</a>, maybe some art and (of course) books! </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_bohoBoard-min.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I’m picturing this nook in the corner of our front room. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%206-min.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture it though, keep the lamp or replace it with a cool, modern <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V64NBDM/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_k4-uAbKCY0E9N\" target=\"_blank\">sconce</a>. That’ll give you great daytime or nighttime reading light. The macramé could be switched out with a framed book sleeve or poster. There’s already a side table for holding coffee or the current reading stack (mood board table <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718Z3G9D/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_l7-uAbXR2ZAWM\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0767P4FGZ/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_Ke.uAbC1Y11BK\" target=\"_blank\">This rug</a> caught my eye.

I, for one, wouldn’t mind spending a good amount of time in that scene. You can find a post I wrote for the fabric.com blog about how to mix and match fabrics <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/tips-for-mixing-matching-fabric-in-your-home/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"farmhousebooknook\">Farmhouse Book Nook</h4>\n\n<p>For a more neutral look, here’s another board full of style and DIY projects! </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_farmBoard.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Using beautiful <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> in curtains, for throw pillows and as the pendant would give it so much texture and warmth.</p>\n\n<p>For this farmhouse-inspired nook, I included my DIY embroidery hoop pendant light. Ours was large but you could choose any size and any kind of fabrics to get a very cool, very custom look. Read more about that <a href=\"https://www.househomemade.us/2016/11/embroidery-hoop-chandelier-shade.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also couldn’t help but add the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YD8E22/ref=twister_B009L33VP8?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">leaning book shelf</a> because, as I shared with you earlier, we’ve made one of those for my desk.

I feel like a kids space can be pulled together even easier than the others.  Here’s what I came up with for a kid’s reading nook.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/cb-2448_blog_readingNook_kiddieBoard-min.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Isn’t that so fun?! The fabric I picked for this space makes me so happy!! First off, I love every single fabric by <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/cotton-steel\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel</a>. It’s all so whimsical and cute. In keeping with the storybook theme, I picked <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0477052/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-wonderland-canvas-wonderland-metallic-navy\" target=\"_blank\">this great Alice in Wonderland fabric</a>. You could use this fabric for a pouf or sew some fluffy throw pillows for the space. I also liked <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476819/cotton-steel-kujira-star-canvas-waves-citron\" target=\"_blank\">this wavy citron fabric</a> to balance with the business of the other. Also, what better way to pull it all together than with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0554318/3-4-tianna-beaded-pom-pom-trim-multi-color\" target=\"_blank\">this colorful pom pom trim</a>….STOP IT!  You could even use that if you made your own little canopy.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%2015.jpeg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Fabric.com even has a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/sb-912/sew-baby-terrific-teepees-pattern\" target=\"_blank\">teepee pattern</a> if you’d rather have something more versatile…and removable.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Reading%20Nooks/pic%2016.jpg\" alt=\"Reading Nook\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For this space, we still have good lighting with the pendant. You could buy one, but I made one with a thrifted basket. Then I added in a little kitty night light, a cozy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYZMKS6/ref=cm_sw_r_pi_dp_U_x_jn.uAb4Z11ARE\" target=\"_blank\">gender neutral rug</a>, some cute art and a playful pennant.

Using a ruler and marking pen, mark a line from the bottom right corner to that mark, repeat for the bottom left corner.\n\nUsing these lines as a guide, and using a ¼” seam allowance on the long edge, sew your triangle all the way around, leaving a gap on the long edge for turning. Trim around your shape, clipping the corners for sharp points. \n\nTopstitch using a longer stitch length about 1/8 inch from the edge. This will also close the space you left to turn your triangle.\nYour envelope top is complete!\n\n#####Envelope bottom:\nWith the two 3.5” x 6.5” pieces placed on top of each other, sew all the way around, leaving a space to turn on one long edge.\n\nTurn your rectangle inside out after trimming the corner for sharp points.\n\nTopstitch as before, using a longer stitch length, this will close your opening that you left for turning.\n\n#####Envelope Placement:\nThis depends on personal preference, but to make your finished block, \nPlace the envelope bottom on your background square, centered but a little bit down from middle. This was about 3.5” from each side for us, and 4.5” from the top and bottom. It doesn’t have to be perfect!\n\nSew your envelope on the background fabric, leaving the top open, and locking at the beginning and end. \n\nPlace your triangle over the envelope bottom, about ½” – ¾” above it. Sew this down onto the background fabric, locking your stitches at the beginning and end, careful not to cover the pocket.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Envelope Block](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Envelope%20Quilt%20Block/finished_open-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nThere you have it – an adorable envelope block perfect for your Valentine.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Envelope Block](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Envelope%20Quilt%20Block/CB-2462_blog_pocketQuilt_img.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n",

Using a ruler and marking pen, mark a line from the bottom right corner to that mark, repeat for the bottom left corner.</p>\n\n<p>Using these lines as a guide, and using a ¼” seam allowance on the long edge, sew your triangle all the way around, leaving a gap on the long edge for turning. Trim around your shape, clipping the corners for sharp points. </p>\n\n<p>Topstitch using a longer stitch length about 1/8 inch from the edge. This will also close the space you left to turn your triangle. <br />\nYour envelope top is complete!</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"envelopebottom\">Envelope bottom:</h5>\n\n<p>With the two 3.5” x 6.5” pieces placed on top of each other, sew all the way around, leaving a space to turn on one long edge.</p>\n\n<p>Turn your rectangle inside out after trimming the corner for sharp points.</p>\n\n<p>Topstitch as before, using a longer stitch length, this will close your opening that you left for turning.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"envelopeplacement\">Envelope Placement:</h5>\n\n<p>This depends on personal preference, but to make your finished block, <br />\nPlace the envelope bottom on your background square, centered but a little bit down from middle. This was about 3.5” from each side for us, and 4.5” from the top and bottom. It doesn’t have to be perfect!</p>\n\n<p>Sew your envelope on the background fabric, leaving the top open, and locking at the beginning and end. </p>\n\n<p>Place your triangle over the envelope bottom, about ½” – ¾” above it. Sew this down onto the background fabric, locking your stitches at the beginning and end, careful not to cover the pocket.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Envelope%20Quilt%20Block/finished_open-min.PNG\" alt=\"Envelope Block\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>There you have it – an adorable envelope block perfect for your Valentine.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Envelope%20Quilt%20Block/CB-2462_blog_pocketQuilt_img.jpg\" alt=\"Envelope Block\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy sewing!</p>",

When using a standard sewing machine, use a zig zag stitch for best results.\n\nThe 2 key points to make this waistband method successful is making sure the fabric waist portion of your project allows for the width of the elastic in order to do so, and an effective top stitch.\n\nOnce the elastic is applied, simply fold it under and top stitch. When top stitching, choose a zig zag stitch on a standard machine, or a coverstitch or chainstitch on a serger. Stretching the waistband as you topstitch allows for the topstitch to be able to complement the stretch performance. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/self%20elastic%20sewn%20on-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/self%20top%20stitch-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/self%20underside-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####2) Separate Waistband, Sewn-in:\n\n#####For this example, we used a standard sewing machine, and the following supplies:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/skus_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0440277/kaufman-burly-beavers-flannel-collage-iron\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Burly Beavers Flannel Collage Iron</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0442489/yarn-dyed-flannel-check-red-black\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn Dyed Flannel Check Red Black</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0371970/heavy-stretch-waistband-elastic-1-1-2x1-1-4yd-white\" target=\"_blank\">Heavy Stretch Waistband Elastic 1-1/2\"X1-1/4yd-White</a>\n\nThe elastic is sewn onto the seam allowance of the main fabric and separate waistband fabric. It is then fully enclosed with the remaining waist fabric being folded over, and then secured with a stitch in the ditch. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/beaver%20pin%20elastic-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/beaver%20stitching%20elastic-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/beaver%20waistband%20layer-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n“Stitch in the ditch” refers to sewing a top stitch in the crevice between 2 fabrics. This technique is effective for creating a seamless transition between fabrics, while securing fabric on the underside. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/beaver%20stitch%20in%20the%20ditch-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####3) Elastic Casing Waistband\nMaking a casing is an easy way to accomplish an elastic waistband. It doesn’t require any stretching while sewing, or sewing through the elastic itself (other than joining the elastic). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20done-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMaking a casing can be done with the self-fabric, or by attaching a separate piece of fabric for the waistband. Using the self-waistband method, you would simply fold the fabric under, the width of the elastic + seam allowance. Top stitch to secure, leaving an opening to thread the elastic thru. Once the elastic is joined, top stitch to close. \n\n#####For this example, we used a serger and these supplies:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/skus_3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0478734/art-gallery-wonderful-things-jersey-knit-aquarelle-study-tint\" target=\"_blank\">Art Gallery Wonderful Things Jersey Knit Aquarelle Study Tint</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0545404/stretch-jersey-knit-solid-bright-coral\" target=\"_blank\">Stretch Jersey Knit Solid Bright Coral</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/e-038/1-white-flat-no-roll-elastic\" target=\"_blank\">1'' White Flat No-Roll Elastic</a>\n\nThe key to making a casing, is exact measurements. If the waistband casing is too small, the elastic will not lay properly. If the casing is too big, it risks too much movement for the elastic.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20elastic%20formula-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20waist%20pinned-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20leave%20opening-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20guide%20thru-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nA good way to counteract any unwanted movement from the waistband, is to use <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/e-038/1-white-flat-no-roll-elastic\" target=\"_blank\">no-roll elastic</a>, also known as woven elastic. It’s more stable than knitted or braided elastic. It does require the butted method to join, since it is too dense to overlap and sew nicely.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20butted%20elastic-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/casing%20sew%20opening-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n(picture waistbands done)\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waistbands](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Elastic%20Waistbands/waistbands%20done-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHappy Sewing!\n\n\n\n",

Shirt buttons are predominantly 4-hole buttons and when examining a professionally made shirt, a 4-hole button with a shank is standard. The thread shank allows for the thickness of the joining fabric, so when buttoned, both fabrics will lay flat. The thread shank also joins 4 sets of button thread stitches on the underside of the button, cinching them together so that they fit properly within the buttonhole.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/4hole%20side%20by%20side-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/thread%20shank-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFor the 2-hole and 4-hole button examples, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0364121/kaufman-chambray-45-oz-washed-light-indigo\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Chambray 4.5 Oz Washed Light Indigo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0362984/dress-it-up-color-me-collection-pillow-pack-buttons-blue-hawaiian\" target=\"_blank\">Dress it up Buttons</a>.\n  \n####2-Hole Button\nSimply stitching in and out joining the button to the fabric will create a stable button, flush with the fabric. It’s best used when the joining fabric isn’t very thick, the button won’t be heavily used, or for decorative buttons. Sewing a 2-hole button doesn’t necessarily require a thread shank.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/2hole-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Shank Button\nSewing a shank button is as easy as stitching in and out. The key here is the direction of the shank, making sure it’s the same orientation as the button hole for a proper fit. Shank buttons are common with coats and jackets. Depending on the thickness of the fabric, a shank button might require an additional thread shank, so the joining fabric doesn’t pucker.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/shank-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/shank%20done-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nFor this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/riley-blake-wool-blend-melton\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Wool Melton</a> in Orange and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Slimline-Buttons-2-Brown-Imitation-Leather/dp/B00483D3Z4/ref=sr_1_2?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1517864921&sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">3/4\" Faux Leather Shank buttons</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing a Button](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/CB-2496_blog_button_img-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing buttons!\n\n\n\n\n",

Depending on the thickness of the fabric, a shank button might require an additional thread shank, so the joining fabric doesn’t pucker.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/shank-min.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing a Button\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/shank%20done-min.JPG\" alt=\"Sewing a Button\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/riley-blake-wool-blend-melton\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Wool Melton</a> in Orange and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Slimline-Buttons-2-Brown-Imitation-Leather/dp/B00483D3Z4/ref=sr_1_2?s=arts-crafts&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517864921&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">3/4\" Faux Leather Shank buttons</a>.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Sewing%20a%20Button/CB-2496_blog_button_img-min.jpg\" alt=\"Sewing a Button\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy sewing buttons!</p>",

Each square makes two HST’s.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![HSTs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/2_at_a_time.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Cutting\nCut (1) 6” square from each fabric.\n\n#####Sewing\nMark a diagonal line with your marking pen on one fabric square (it can even be a permanent pen or pencil, this line won’t show on your finished blocks.\n\nWith your two squares placed on top of each other, sew a scant ¼” on each side, remember to backstitch!\n\nCut in between these two sewn lines. Press towards the darker fabric. Trim if needed.\n\n####Method 2: Four at a Time HST’s\nThis method is great because you don’t have to draw any lines at all, which is perfect for a ¼ yard piece of fabric! You’ll be able to get 16 5” square out of an 8.5” strip cut into 4 8.5” squares.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![HSTs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/4_at_a_time.PNG)\n</p>\n\n####Cutting\nCut (1) 8.5” square from each fabric.\n\n#####Sewing\nPlacing one square on the other, sew along the edges at ¼”, pivoting at the corners.\n\nCut in an X formation, corner to corner. Press towards the darker fabric – now you have 4 HST’s!\n\n####Method 3: 8 at a Time HST’s\nThis method is great for yardage, and it’s super easy to cut if you have a 12.5” square ruler.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![HSTs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/8_at_a_time.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Cutting\nCut (1) 12.5” square out of 2 fabrics. \n\n#####Sewing\nPlace one fabric on top of the other. Mark diagonal lines in an X formation. Sew at a scant ¼” on either side of your marked lines. Make sure your fabric stays in place and doesn’t bunch when you sew over existing lines.\n\nCut your fabric in a cross formation, even in the middle on all sides. Then, cut between seams. \n\nPress your triangles towards the darker fabric. Trim if necessary. Now you have 8 HST’s.\n\n####Method 4: Strip HST’s\nThis method is great if you have an eighth of a yard, a quarter of a yard, or even jelly rolls for itty bitty HST’s. This one is tricky and takes some very precise cutting.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![HSTs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/strip_method.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Cutting\nCut (1) 4.5” strip of each fabric by however long you want. If you want a lot, cut by WOF (Width of Fabric).\n\n#####Sewing\nSew your two strips along the long edges at ¼” seam allowance.\n\nUsing your square ruler, place your ruler as demonstrated in the video. The tip of the square should just touch the top seam. Cut on each side. For the next HST, you will flip your ruler so the point is in the opposite direction, but will only have to cut one side.\nKeep cutting until you run out of strip to cut from. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![HSTs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/CB-2471_blog_hst_img2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy HST making!\n\n\n",

Press towards the darker fabric – now you have 4 HST’s!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"method38atatimehsts\">Method 3: 8 at a Time HST’s</h4>\n\n<p>This method is great for yardage, and it’s super easy to cut if you have a 12.5” square ruler.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/8_at_a_time.PNG\" alt=\"HSTs\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"cutting\">Cutting</h5>\n\n<p>Cut (1) 12.5” square out of 2 fabrics. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"sewing\">Sewing</h5>\n\n<p>Place one fabric on top of the other. Mark diagonal lines in an X formation. Sew at a scant ¼” on either side of your marked lines. Make sure your fabric stays in place and doesn’t bunch when you sew over existing lines.</p>\n\n<p>Cut your fabric in a cross formation, even in the middle on all sides. Then, cut between seams. </p>\n\n<p>Press your triangles towards the darker fabric. Trim if necessary. Now you have 8 HST’s.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"method4striphsts\">Method 4: Strip HST’s</h4>\n\n<p>This method is great if you have an eighth of a yard, a quarter of a yard, or even jelly rolls for itty bitty HST’s. This one is tricky and takes some very precise cutting.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/strip_method.PNG\" alt=\"HSTs\" />\n</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"cutting\">Cutting</h5>\n\n<p>Cut (1) 4.5” strip of each fabric by however long you want. If you want a lot, cut by WOF (Width of Fabric).</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"sewing\">Sewing</h5>\n\n<p>Sew your two strips along the long edges at ¼” seam allowance.</p>\n\n<p>Using your square ruler, place your ruler as demonstrated in the video. The tip of the square should just touch the top seam. Cut on each side. For the next HST, you will flip your ruler so the point is in the opposite direction, but will only have to cut one side. <br />\nKeep cutting until you run out of strip to cut from. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20HSTs/CB-2471_blog_hst_img2.jpg\" alt=\"HSTs\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy HST making!</p>",

I grew up happily immersed in all things domestic. I’m the middle child of a large family and live closely surrounded by grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. My mom says that I was practically born with a needle in my hand. My earliest memories are of sitting underneath the quilting frames and threading needles for my grandma and great aunts until I eventually grew old enough to make stitches of my own. As a girl, I spent many happy hours designing and sewing clothes for my dolls, crocheting and doing embroidery.\n\n\nMy deep love of all needle art comes from the early influence of my mother and grandmothers, who were my first teachers. Now I teach others to create and I find joy in using my creativity to make beautiful things. I am drawn to stacks of colorful fabrics, pretty papers, aprons, buttons, embroidery, old dishes, gingham and polka dots, sprinkles and glitter and all things vintage. I am married to my best friend and childhood sweetheart and together we have 3 creative, intelligent children, and a new baby granddaughter. Life is good! I sew, draw, create, decorate and re-decorate on a daily basis. I think of myself as the luckiest girl in the world, because I get to do what I love everyday. I feel blessed to have my own company called, “Bee in my Bonnet,” which I began in 1994. My wish is that my designs in both patterns and fabric, will inspire others to create and will also instill the desire to pass down the valuable lessons of days gone by taught to us by our mothers and grandmothers.\n\n####Q&A\n\n#####When did you realize you had a passion for design?\nI knew I had a passion for design when I was a girl. My mom taught my 3 older sisters and I how to sew, and as we were following patterns I often found myself changing them up. My mom and my grandma were free with their fabrics and supplies…allowing me to create whatever my heart desired. \n\n#####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Lori%20Holt/cb-2500_loriHolt_answer1.png)\n</p>\n\n#####Your newest collection, Bake Sale 2, is now available on fabric.com!

Erin from Sewbon here today to bring you a quick and simple sewing project – a wholecloth quilt featuring wool and chambray! This project is a great way to mix seasonal substrates for something warm and cozy, or even light and airy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-8-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhile I actually have a pretty good collection of quilt patterns in my stash that I dream of one day sewing, sometimes I’m just too impatient to sew a “real quilt”! So, to get my quilt-y fix, I make wholecloth quilts. It’s such a good instant gratification project because it’s simple and sews up so quickly!\n\nTypically, I make whole cloth quilts as baby gifts, but this time I supersized it and made a twin size version. This size is perfect to cuddle up with on the couch or to drape across the foot of the bed for those cold winter nights. Plus, the wool makes it extra warm and cozy!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-11-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n####Supplies\n* 4 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=melton\" target=\"_blank\">Wool Blend Melton fabric</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/riley-blake-wool-blend-melton\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Melton Wool</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0511302/riley-blake-melton-wool-blend-gray\" target=\"_blank\">Gray</a>)\n* 4 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=chambray\" target=\"_blank\">Chambray fabric</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-chambray-stitched\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kaufman Stitched Yarn Dyed Chambray</a>)\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/cbr-003/warm-natural-cotton-batting-twin-sized\" target=\"_blank\">Twin Size Warm & Natural Cotton Batting</a>\n* General Sewing Supplies\n\n####Instructions\n\n####Step 1\nCut your fabric as follows:\n\n* Wool – Cut in half so you have (2) 2-yard pieces\n* Chambray – Cut in fourths so you have (4) 1-yard pieces\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_instructions1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_instructions2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Step 2\nSew the wool pieces right sides together along the 2-yard edge.\n\n####Step 3\nSew two pieces of the fabric with one dot side and one stripe side together along the 1-yard edge. Repeat for the other two pieces.\n\n####Step 4\nSew the two stitched panels of fabric together along the long edge so you have a quilt top made of four rectangles.\n\n####Step 5\nAssemble the quilt sandwich by placing the batting down first, then the wool right side up, then the quilt top right side down. Safety pin generously through all three layers so that the layers are smooth and don’t shift.\n\n####Step 6\nTrim the edges of the quilt sandwich so they are all even.\n\n####Step 7\nUsing a walking foot, sew around the edges of the quilt sandwich at a ½ inch seam allowance, leaving a 12-inch opening.\n\n####Step 8\nTurn the quilt right side out through the 12-inch opening.\n\n####Step 9\nSew around the entire quilt with a ¾ inch seam allowance, closing the opening as you sew.\n\nAnd that’s it! If you’d like, you can tack the layers of the quilt together or quilt some lines, but I found the weight to be heavy enough that it stayed in place nicely.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Wholecloth Quilt](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-6-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n",

Erin from Sewbon here today to bring you a quick and simple sewing project – a wholecloth quilt featuring wool and chambray! This project is a great way to mix seasonal substrates for something warm and cozy, or even light and airy.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-8-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-3-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>While I actually have a pretty good collection of quilt patterns in my stash that I dream of one day sewing, sometimes I’m just too impatient to sew a “real quilt”! So, to get my quilt-y fix, I make wholecloth quilts. It’s such a good instant gratification project because it’s simple and sews up so quickly!</p>\n\n<p>Typically, I make whole cloth quilts as baby gifts, but this time I supersized it and made a twin size version. This size is perfect to cuddle up with on the couch or to drape across the foot of the bed for those cold winter nights. Plus, the wool makes it extra warm and cozy!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-1-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-11-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"supplies\">Supplies</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=melton\" target=\"_blank\">Wool Blend Melton fabric</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/riley-blake-wool-blend-melton\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Melton Wool</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0511302/riley-blake-melton-wool-blend-gray\" target=\"_blank\">Gray</a>)</li>\n<li>4 yards of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=chambray\" target=\"_blank\">Chambray fabric</a> (we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-chambray-stitched\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kaufman Stitched Yarn Dyed Chambray</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/cbr-003/warm-natural-cotton-batting-twin-sized\" target=\"_blank\">Twin Size Warm &amp; Natural Cotton Batting</a></li>\n<li>General Sewing Supplies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"instructions\">Instructions</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"step1\">Step 1</h4>\n\n<p>Cut your fabric as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wool – Cut in half so you have (2) 2-yard pieces</li>\n<li>Chambray – Cut in fourths so you have (4) 1-yard pieces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_instructions1-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_instructions2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step2\">Step 2</h4>\n\n<p>Sew the wool pieces right sides together along the 2-yard edge.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step3\">Step 3</h4>\n\n<p>Sew two pieces of the fabric with one dot side and one stripe side together along the 1-yard edge. Repeat for the other two pieces.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step4\">Step 4</h4>\n\n<p>Sew the two stitched panels of fabric together along the long edge so you have a quilt top made of four rectangles.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step5\">Step 5</h4>\n\n<p>Assemble the quilt sandwich by placing the batting down first, then the wool right side up, then the quilt top right side down. Safety pin generously through all three layers so that the layers are smooth and don’t shift.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step6\">Step 6</h4>\n\n<p>Trim the edges of the quilt sandwich so they are all even.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step7\">Step 7</h4>\n\n<p>Using a walking foot, sew around the edges of the quilt sandwich at a ½ inch seam allowance, leaving a 12-inch opening.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step8\">Step 8</h4>\n\n<p>Turn the quilt right side out through the 12-inch opening.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"step9\">Step 9</h4>\n\n<p>Sew around the entire quilt with a ¾ inch seam allowance, closing the opening as you sew.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s it! If you’d like, you can tack the layers of the quilt together or quilt some lines, but I found the weight to be heavy enough that it stayed in place nicely.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-4-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Chambray%20Wool%20Wholecloth%20Quilt/Sewbon_Whole_Cloth_Quilt_Fabicdotcom-6-min.jpg\" alt=\"Wholecloth Quilt\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy sewing!</p>",

We want to make sure your creations last a lifetime, so we’re kicking off a 2-part Sewing 101 all about seams. First we will go over basic seams for woven fabrics, and in the second installment we will cover all things knits!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppbepnhhFMc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Plain Seam\nThe most basic of all seams, a plain seam is simply a straight stitch joining multiple pieces of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a>. Your <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> and project will determine the needle, stitch length, and tension setting on the sewing machine. For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0269370/cotton-twill-red\" target=\"_blank\">Red Cotton Twill fabric</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/plain%20seam.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou can use Universal (Regular Point) needles for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=woven\" target=\"_blank\">woven fabrics</a>. Their sharp point penetrates the fabric as it sews. Here’s a quick needle guide for size: \n\n#####Needle Guide\nVery Lightweight or Sheer Wovens: 70/09\nLightweight Wovens: 80/11\nMedium Weight Wovens: 90/14\nHeavyweight Wovens: 100/16\nVery Heavyweight Wovens: 100/18\n\n\nUpon creating a plain seam, most likely a seam finish is required. A seam finish secures the seam allowance fabric so that it doesn’t fray or unravel. \n\nTip: You could choose to finish the edges before sewing the fabrics together, or after the seam is created. For beginner apparel sewing, we recommend finishing the edges prior to sewing a plain seam. For removable pillow covers, finishing the edges prior to sewing is easier because many home décor fabrics are easily frayed. Mostly, seam finishing in home décor sewing is not required at all since the fabric edge will never be disturbed or seen, such as upholstery sewing. \n\n#####Zig Zag Seam Finish\nThe Zig Zag seam finish can be done on a standard machine. Zig zag stitch each seam allowance piece (or both joined together) and trim any excess fabric. Tip: When trimming, avoid cutting the zig zag stitching.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/Zig%20zag%20finish.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Overedge Zig Zag Seam Finish\nThis method cannot be used on very lightweight fabric, because it requires the right points of the zig zag stitch to go outside of the fabric. This is a very effective finishing method if a serger cannot be used.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/Overegde%20zig%20zag%20finish.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/Overedge%20in%20action.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Overedge Stitch on a Serger\nThis stitch can be done with or without the straight stitch (or chain stitch) depending on what kind of serger it is. A 5-thread serger can sew a plain seam, trim any excess, and finish the seam edge all in one step. These machines can be quite an investment, but it can save lots of time and give professional results from home.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/Serger%20overedge%20finish.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Stitch and Pink Seam Finish\nA classic seam finish, simply straight stitch each seam allowance piece, then trim the excess with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gingher-Inch-Pinking-Shears-01-005272/dp/B000MWXPKI/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1519274494&sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">pinking shears</a>  or a pinking rotary blade. A pinked edge will not unravel, but may fray slightly over time. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/Stitch%20and%20Pink%20edge%20finish.JPG)\n</p>\n\nTime saving tip: depending on the project, you could skip the additional straight stitch step, and just trim the excess seam allowance fabric with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gingher-Inch-Pinking-Shears-01-005272/dp/B000MWXPKI/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1519274494&sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">pinking shears</a>. \n\n####Flat Felled Seam\nThe flat felled seam is an ultra-secure, flat, and somewhat decorative seam most commonly used in jeans and pants construction. A combination of 2 visible stitches, this seam is fully enclosed. For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0530783/cotton-yarn-dye-chambray-denim-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton Yarn Dye Chambray Denim Blue Fabric</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/flat%20felled%20seam.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 1\nSew wrong sides together 5/8” seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/flat%20fell%20step%201.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 2\nTrim one side to 1/8”.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/flat%20fell%20step%202.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 3\nFold remaining 5/8” side under and over the trimmed 1/8” side, and top stitch.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/flat%20fell%20step%203.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####French Seam\nFrench seams are ideal for delicate, sheer, or very lightweight fabric such as chiffon or crepe. A combination of 2 stitches, this seam is fully enclosed. For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0462791/telio-misora-crepe-de-chine-seafoam\" target=\"_blank\">Telio Misora Crepe Fabric in Seafoam</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/French%20seam.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 1\nSew wrong sides together 3/8”.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/french%20step%201.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 2\nTrim seam allowance to 1/8”.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/french%20step%202.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Step 3\nTurn fabric right sides together making the seam along the fold, press if needed, and sew ¼” seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/french%20step%203.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt.%201%20Wovens/CB-2497_blog_seam1_img3.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe will see you next time for part 2 of seam basics on knit fabrics.\n\n\n",

Be sure you’re working in a well ventilated area and protect your work surfaces and clothing from overspray.\n\nTest a small swatch of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for color fastness and bleeding.

We’ll be wrapping the legs individually first. Be sure to cut out fabric for each leg in the same direction so that they all match! Cut out a rectangle with fabric scissors to cover all four sides of the leg. Allow for at least a ½” folded overlap at the seam and a ½” folded edge at the top and bottom of the leg.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8457Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPress a ½” fold along the vertical length of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> with an iron before applying the fabric to the table leg. After spraying the leg with glue, apply the folded edge about a ¼” from the corner edge. Press down while the glue sets. Take care to keep the folded edge flush with the top and bottom ends of the table leg. Apply glue to each side and wrap the table leg with the remaining fabric.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8461Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8463Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold and press the remaining overlap to create a sharp crease and apply adhesive to the underside of the flap. Press down firmly to adhere it to the leg. Set aside so the glue has a chance to set and wrap the remaining legs using the same steps.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8469_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8471_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nMeasure and cut out a square of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> to cover the bottom of the table and add an extra ½” on each side to create an overhang. Apply Glue to the unfinished bottom of the side table and smooth down the fabric maintaining the ½” overhang on all sides. After gluing down all four sides of the overhang, snip each corner and overlap the extra fabric to create a sharp corner before gluing down. When covering the top of the table this overlap will ensure there won’t be a seam where the table finish is exposed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8472_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8478_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe final piece of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> you cut will be the largest and will cover the top of the table. It should be long enough on two opposite ends to and fold in ½” along the bottom edge of the table, and 4-5” inches extra length on the two remaining opposite ends so that creased corner tabs can be created and stapled underneath the table. Apply glue to the entire surface of the table and smooth down the fabric so that there are no wrinkles.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8476_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFlip the table back upside down and fold up the shorter ends folding in the extra fabric to create a seam at the bottom edge of the table. Press with an iron to create a sharp edge. Secure the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> with adhesive and repeat on the remaining side.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8487_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8488_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold the remaining excess fabric just like if you were wrapping a present. Grab a corner and pull it inward along the top edge, creating a right triangle. Use a quick spray of adhesive to keep it in place. Repeat with the other side. Spray the wrong side of the fabric with glue and pull the tab tightly over the table edge and press onto the underside of the side table. Keep the tab tightly in place with staples along the folded edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8495_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8496Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPlace staples at the top and bottom of each leg to reinforce the fold at the seam before re-assembling the table and styling in your bedroom!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Bedroom Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Bedroom%20Refresh%20Fabric%20Wrapped%20Side%20Table/IMG_8541_Lindsey_Crafter-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis is a great way to update your room on a budget. I even picked out a few more fresh <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fabrics</a> to make some fresh throw pillows.

It should be long enough on two opposite ends to and fold in ½” along the bottom edge of the table, and 4-5” inches extra length on the two remaining opposite ends so that creased corner tabs can be created and stapled underneath the table.

Stretch or Jersey Knit needles may also be appropriate depending on what kind of knit fabric you’re working with. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-304/schmetz-stretch-machine-needles-11-75\" target=\"_blank\">Stretch needles</a> have a longer scarf (better for knits with more than 5% Lycra Spandex).\n \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-309/schmetz-ball-point-machine-needle-assortment\" target=\"_blank\">Jersey knit needle</a>s have an even more round point than Universal ball points do. \nFor more information on machines and needles, check out <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/sewing-with-knits/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/CB-2498_blog_seam2_img2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What you need to know about knits\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=knit\" target=\"_blank\">Knit Fabrics</a> are made up of interlocking loops of fine yarns. The rounded point of a machine needle glides through the fibers rather than penetrating them, preserving fabric quality.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=knit&product-features=stretch\" target=\"_blank\">Knits</a> can have mechanical stretch and/or Lycra Spandex generated stretch. \n\nMechanical stretch refers to the natural give that the interlocking loops experience when being pulled. The looser the loops have been knitted, the stretchier the fabric will be. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=knit&fiber-content-range=lycra-spandex-blends\" target=\"_blank\">Lycra Spandex stretch</a> refers to the incorporation of 1-20% Lycra Spandex fiber that has been added to the primary fiber contents. This gives any fabric stretch, and makes knits extra stretchy since they already have mechanical stretch by nature. \n\nFor more information on stretch, check out <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/blog/fabric-101-determining-stretch-direction-stretch-percentage/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a> and watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZZfTX1ljao\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>.\n \n####Stitch options\n#####Zig Zag Stitch\nThis is a very basic stitch that joins knit fabric, and accounts for lengthwise (vertical) stretch. Simply trimming any excess fabric from the seam allowance will reduce bulk. This stitch is not ideal for tight, form fitting knit garments – because the fabric can pucker through the zig zags when heavily stretched on the crosswise (horizontal) grain. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/zig%20zag.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/trim%20zig%20zag.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Shallow Zig Zag Stitch\nAlso called “narrow zig zag” - this stitch resembles a straight stitch, while still accounting for some stretch. The fabric will not pucker through the seam stitch. This seam is great for knits that will not be stretched vertically, since it can be slightly limiting to lengthwise stretch. For the zig zag stitch examples, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/et-542/kaufman-laguna-stretch-cotton-jersey-knit-pink-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Laguna Jersey Knit in Pink</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/shallow%20zig%20zag.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####Stretch Stitch\nThis straight stitch is made possible by switching your machines settings to “stretch”. It has the appearance and function of a straight stitch, but each stitch is actually made up of 3 lightning bolt style stitches. This accounts for stretch vertically and horizontally, making it a great stitch for knits. Two downsides to this stitch is that it takes a bit of extra time to sew, and it is almost impossible to remove if the seam without damaging the fabric, should the seam need to be undone for any reason. For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0304993/riley-blake-knit-solid-hot-pink\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Jersey Knit in Hot Pink</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/machine%20stretch%20setting.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/stretch%20stitch.JPG)\n</p>\n\n#####4-Thread Overedge Stitch\nThis seam is the most common for professionally made knit garments. This seam can be done on a 4 or 5-thread serger. Sergers have an adjustable “differential feed” function that beautifully sew knits or any other fabrics that have a tendency to distort under pressure. For this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0545404/stretch-jersey-knit-solid-bright-coral\" target=\"_blank\">Fabric Merchants Stretch Cotton Jersey Knit in Bright Coral</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Seam Basics Pt 2 Knits](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%20Seam%20Basics%20Pt%202%20Knits/serger.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHappy Sewing!\n",

Marcy of oonaballoona here, ready to enable your new <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/supreme-african-wax-print-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">African Wax Print</a> obsession. Because once you start… you won’t stop!\n\nThis fabric has long been a favorite of mine, largely due to its colorful nature and wonderful patterns. It has an interesting history, originating in Holland, intended as a knockoff of Indonesian Batik print. The Indonesian market didn’t respond to the brighter, graphic designs of wax print, but it found a delighted reception in Africa. Therefore, you might hear it called Dutch Wax Print, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/supreme-african-wax-print-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">African Wax Print</a>, or Ankara. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![African Wax Print](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/African%20Wax%20Dress/0555917.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWax print is 48” wide, but, you get a whopping six yards in every cut. SIX. YARDS. So the possibilities in a single cut are fairly endless! I’ve actually made two garments from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/supreme-african-wax-print-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">this single cut</a>— one is a maxi skirt awaiting a waistband, and the other is this little yellow wrap dress of sunshine, a modified <a href=\"https://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m7246\" target=\"_blank\">@McCalls 7246</a>. And I still have decent sized remnants left!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![African Wax Print](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/African%20Wax%20Dress/0538175.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHere are my tips for working with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/supreme-african-wax-print-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">African Wax Print</a> fabric, in no particular order:\n\n####Choose a simple pattern\nChoose a simple pattern for your first foray, something that won’t break up the print too much. As you get deeper into this obsession, it’s loads of fun to choose patterns with lots of pieces, to incorporate all the scraps you’ll accumulate (like I said, six yards in a cut)! For example, I’ve used scraps from another garment to face my hem.\n\n####Embrace the print\nEven with careful planning, you’re likely to get a circle, bird, or what-have you highlighting a place you didn't intend. Consider this when placing your pattern, but when working with a repeating print like this, it’s bound to highlight an area anyway!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![African Wax Print](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/African%20Wax%20Dress/P1040368-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Remove your stickers with care\nAuthentic wax print comes with a sticky label. Place your pressing cloth over the label, and use a hot iron to melt the glue. Then, you can easily pull the label off.\n\n####Use both sides\nAnother great thing about wax print is the wrong side— as you can see in the photo detailing the faced hem, the colors are almost as vibrant on the wrong side as the right side. If you’re working with a print that involves symbols, as many wax prints do, you can flip over to the reverse to get a mirror image.\n\n####To wash, or not to wash?\nIt’s your call! Wax print comes, as the title suggests, with wax embedded in the fabric. This gives it a crisp, stiff drape, great for structural styles that need shape. If you want to take advantage of the wax, it’ll need to be a “dry clean only” garment. If you’d like a softer cotton, simply give it a pre-wash, and it’ll soften right up (I like to wash on cold and dry on low heat, as that’s how I treat most of my handmade items).\n\n####Go against the grain\nThe skirt of this dress was cut on the crossgrain. I’ve made many wax garments cut on the crossgrain— just be sure you’re thinking about the stress you might put on the garment. You wouldn’t want to make a pencil skirt on the crossgrain, that’d be too much stress for the crossgrain! Here, the bodice of the dress, which takes more stress than the loose, wide skirt, is cut on the lengthwise grain.\n\nLastly, HAVE FUN. Though really, when playing with these candy colors, what other choice do you have?\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![African Wax Print](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/African%20Wax%20Dress/P1040355-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n \n",

Though really, when playing with these candy colors, what other choice do you have?</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/African%20Wax%20Dress/P1040355-min.jpg\" alt=\"African Wax Print\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy sewing!</p>",

This step takes patience, but will make construction much easier, and the final product will be higher quality. \n\nSnip a piece of fabric so that you can locate a warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) thread. Pull those threads out of the fabric, and you will have created your own guide to the grain of the fabric. Laying it on a gridded cutting mat will allow you to line up the absent warp and weft thread lines with the grid. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/warp%20thread-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n*Tip: When removing the warp thread, do it closely to the selvage so the absent thread isn’t visible in your fabric pieces. When removing the weft thread, be mindful of how the pattern will be placed on the fabric, so that the fabric pieces will not have a missing weft thread. \n\nUse pattern weights instead of pins. This prevents fabric shifting from all the work you just did laying out the fabric properly. \n\nInstead of scissors to cut out chiffon, use a fresh, sharp rotary blade on a cutting mat to cut the chiffon. This cutting method prevents the fabric shifting. You just spent all that time getting the fabric warp and weft lined up with a pattern, no need to discard that by handling it with scissors.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/rotary%20cutter-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNow that your fabric pieces are beautifully cut, use fine sharp pins to pin pieces together.\n\nWhen sewing, use a walking foot and a sharp machine needle, size 70/09 or less. Fine weight, or bobbin thread is recommended. Avoid backstitching, and hand tie thread tails.\n\n####Seams\nFrench seams are ideal for chiffon. Check out this video for French seams. A 4-thread overedge stitch on a serger will work as well, just adjust the differential feed on your serger so that the stitches are closer together, since chiffon is easily unraveled.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/french%20seam-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/chiffon%20serger-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Hemming\nA rolled hem, or narrow hem on a serger is ideal for chiffon. A great trick for a rolled hem with chiffon, is to stitch the first role with a ½” fold under, trim the excess to 1/8”, turn again and topstitch. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/narrow%20hems-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Binding\nFor neck and arm openings, a bias strip binding is best. It is easily achieved with a trick: heavy starch. If the chiffon is machine washable, give the chiffon bias strip and unfinished edges a spray of heavy starch, and iron to set. The chiffon turns into a crisp, organdy-like fabric that is easy to work with. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/bias%20strip-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Pressing\nThe heat from an iron has a magical way of de-warping fabric and seams from sewing. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/press-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Stabilizing\nThis leads us to emphasize our favorite chiffon sewing tip: heavy starch! The only downside is that it’s not recommended for silk chiffons. Once the fabric pieces are cut, starching 2” of the fabric edges make sewing chiffon easier than ever. Simply machine wash and dry your finished project to remove the starch, and it will be soft, flowy and sewn beautifully.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sewing 101 Chiffon](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Chiffon/cb-2583_chiffon-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing with chiffon!\n\n\n\n\n",

You can do this with a rotary cutter and mat, or just sewing scissors.\n\nWith right sides together, sew at a ½” seam all the way around.

Only the sections where the “arms” meet the body need to be clipped. Make sure not to cut through any of your stitching.\n\nTurn your cactus right side out.

Did you know that this technique dates back to the 1800s? It can be used in many larger blocks like the Dutchman’s Puzzle and any blocks featuring stars. Or, use them as is to create fun patterns that are graphic and modern!\n  \nAll of the instructions in this post will produce 2x4” finished blocks, but check out the handy charts below for other common finished sizes.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzc-DZBd4LY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Supplies Needed\n* 2 contrasting <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/quilting-fabric\" target=\"_blank\">quilting fabrics</a> (we used Kona Cotton <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/am-039/kona-cotton-snow\" target=\"_blank\">Snow</a> to contrast with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dz-508/kona-cotton-chartreuse\" target=\"_blank\">Chartreuse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dz-499/kona-cotton-bright-pink\" target=\"_blank\">Bright Pink</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dz-509/kona-cotton-navy\" target=\"_blank\">Navy</a>)\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns-cutting-tools-mats.aspx?product-type=rotary-blades\" target=\"_blank\">Rotary Cutter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=rulers\" target=\"_blank\">Acrylic Rulers</a> (6.5\" square size and a longer ruler for marking)\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0375098/pilot-frixion-extra-fine-point-erasable-gel-pens-6pkg-assorted-colors\" target=\"_blank\">Marking Pen </a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=mats\" target=\"_blank\">Cutting Mat</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns-thread.aspx?usage=quilting-notions\" target=\"_blank\">Thread</a>\n\n####Method 1: Traditional Method\nThis method is great for scrappy quilters! This method makes one flying geese block, but you will have 3 main segments left over for additional blocks. If you’d like to make four, just add 3 additional 2 7/8” squares of your \"sky\" fabric and cut them in half. This method is great for chain piecing if you cut all your triangles in advance. You do have to be careful when handling your cut fabrics, as you’re working with bias edges that may warp.\n\n#####Cut: \n* (1) 5 ¼” square, cut diagonally into 4 (quarter square) triangles\n* (1) 2 7/8 “ square, cut diagonally into 2 (half square) triangles\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose1.PNG)\n</p>\n\nBias edges together, place one small triangle on the right bias edge of the large triangle, sew at ¼”. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose2.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPress this before sewing your next triangle on.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose3.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPlace the second white triangle on the left bias edge of the main triangle, sew at ¼” seam. Press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose4.PNG)\n</p>\n\nNow you have a 1 flying geese block! You can always trim this for more accurate results.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/cb-2580_flyingGeeseChart_traditional.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Method 2: Stitch and flip Method\nThe Stitch and Flip Method seems to be the most common, but it does produce some waste. But, you can use the extra triangle scraps to make small HST’s for another project! This method is also great for chain-piecing, and using full squares adds extra stability while piecing.\n\n#####Cut:\n* (1) 2.5” x 4.5” of main fabric\n* (2) 2.5” squares of contrast fabric\n\nMark your small white squares diagonally with a marking pen, pencil or chalk. If your fabric is not solid (has a wrong and right side), make sure you have half of your squares with the diagonal line pointing one way and half pointing the other, like the lines of the flying geese block.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose5.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPlace your right contrasting square on the right side of the rectangular piece, making sure your diagonal mark is going left to right and top to bottom. Sew just along the outside of this line to allow for pressing.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose6.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTrim the excess (to the right of the line) and press.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose7.PNG)\n</p>\n\nRepeat this for the left side of the block, making sure your diagonal line is going top to bottom, left to right. \n\nTrim for better accuracy.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose8.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/cb-2580_flyingGeeseChart_flip.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Method 3: Four at a time\nThis method is great for when you need a lot of geese, and the method itself can be mind-boggling, but it’s actually quite easy. Accuracy is extremely important for this method to turn out correctly. \n\n#####Cut:\n* (1) 5 ¼” square of the main color\n* (4) 2 7/8” squares of contrasting color\n\nMark your small squares diagonally.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose9.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPlace two of your small squares on the large square, one in the top left and one in the bottom right, overlapping slightly, with the markings making a diagonal line. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose10.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew a scant ¼” seam on either side of this line. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose11.PNG)\n</p>\n\nCut between the lines and press. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose12.PNG)\n</p>\n\nWith each of these cat-eared segments, place a small square.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose13.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSew a scant ¼” seam on either side of this line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/goose14.PNG)\n</p>\n\nVoila – you have two flying geese! Repeat to the other segment for a total of 4. This is a fun method that is best used for non-directional prints. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/cb-2580_flyingGeeseChart_4up.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWe couldn't resist sewing up a quilt with flying geese using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/liberty-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Fabrics Lawn</a>, and we love the end result!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Flying Geese](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Flying%20Geese/cb-2580_flyingGeese_Quilt.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy sewing!\n\n\n\n\n",

This can make ceilings feel lower and windows smaller. You can drastically create the illusion of higher ceilings by placing curtain rods almost to the ceiling. A good rule of thumb is halfway between the top of the window trim and the ceiling, but take your personal preference into account. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/hanging%20drapes.PNG)\n</p>\n\nStandard drapery panels for 35” windows you can purchase in a store are usually about 50” wide. In most rooms 96” long panels would lightly brush the floor while having a rod placed well above the top of the window trim. If you have an older house you might find the proportions are different and require more customized measurements to adequately cover the window and hit the floor at the proper length. After measuring the width of the final rod placement add an additional 6-8” width to your total width depending on your curtain style to account for seam allowance and some extra gather. \n\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/IMG_8690.jpg)\n</p>\n*Fabric shown: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/uq-056/premier-prints-ikat-domino-drew-slub-berries\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Prints Ikat Domino Drew Slub Berries </a>\n\n####Choose A Hanging/ Installation Method \nNext you'll want to choose a hanging style for your DIY draperies! Today we will cover a few basic styles that are ideal for beginner and intermediate sewists.\n\n#####Rod & Pocket \nThe rod and pocket style is great for novice sewists and renters! You can easily achieve different looks by altering the length and fabric weight of drapery panels. Tension rods are an economical way to hang drapes without installing any hardware that could damage trims. You can sew quick valances with a few yards of fabric to temporarily conceal roller shades and blinds and install in minutes with tension rods! Stylize the hem shape or add  trim to add design elements to the space.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/pocket%20rod%20sketch.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/simple%20rod%20and%20pocket1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/simple%20rod%20and%20pocket2.jpg)\n</p>\n*Fabric shown: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0430392/michael-miller-sommer-sundborn-blueberry\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Miller Sommer Sundborn Blueberry</a>\n\n#####Tabs (Intermediate sewists)\n\nAdding tabs to curtains is a bit more work but can allow for drapes to create larger folds when pulled to the sides instead of bunching up and creating gathers on the rod like the rod + pocket method. Cut and sew 3-4” wide strips to fold in half and attach to the drapery header evenly distributed along the finished width of the panel. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/tabbed%20sketch.PNG)\n</p>\n\n#####Ring Clips\nUsing ring clips is another quick and easy way to create a beautiful effect and is ideal for beginners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/lindsey_crafter_curtains3.jpg)\n</p>\n\n*Fabric shown: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0558520/p-kaufmann-imperial-velvet-drapery-aegean\" target=\"_blank\">P/Kaufmann Imperial Velvet Drapery Aegean </a>\n\n#####Pleat Hooks + Tape\nTransform regular panels with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/201082/traverse-pleater-hooks-10-pkg\" target=\"_blank\">drapery clips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-422/drapery-pleater-tape\" target=\"_blank\">drapery tape</a> to create orderly pleats at the top of the curtains. Just be sure to add an additional 6” per pleat to your overall fabric width to accomodate folds while still covering the windows when drawn closed. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/pleat%20hook%20sketch.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/pleats1.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/pleats2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/pleats3.jpg)\n</p>\n*Fabric shown: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0558525/p-kaufmann-imperial-velvet-drapery-peach-\" target=\"_blank\">P/Kaufmann Imperial Velvet Drapery Peach</a>\n\n#####Grommets\nGet the grommet look without the hammer and hassle! You can now find this hardware in a handy click-together format you can install without any additional tools.  Love these <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/nr-723/curtain-grommets-8-pack-antique-gold-1-9-16\" target=\"_blank\">antique gold grommets</a> on fabric.com!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/grommet%20sketch.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSimply measure and mark hole placement with chalk along the panel’s top edge, distributed equally depending on the amount of grommets in your kit, cut out the center, and press the grommets into place! Now you can easily slide curtain panels onto a curtain rod for easy installation!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/grommet1.jpg)\n</p>\n*Fabric shown: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0531023/cotton-steel-rifle-paper-co-menagerie-canvas-monstera-natural\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Rifle Paper Co. Menagerie Canvas Monstera</a>\n\nHere's a quick guide to DIY draperies that will help you choose the perfect fabric and look for your space!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/cb-2649_diyDrapes_infographic.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Sewing Basic Panels and Linings\nSewing window treatments is a great home improvement project for those just getting comfortable on a sewing machine because essentially you’re only sewing straight lines! No piece work or pattern making required. \n\nOnce you’ve determined the desired dimensions of your finished curtains, add 1” seam allowance to the bottom and sides of the panel and add an additional 3”+ inches to the top of your curtain panel to accommodate the width of your curtain rod (if using rod & pocket method). Turn-under the raw edges ½” and turn over again to create a ½” fold. Press the edge and pin in place before sewing around the outside of the panel. Fold the top edge down 3” and test that your curtain rod can still pass through the channel before top stitching down the fold. This pocket will allow a rod to pass through to easily install in a window.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing1.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing2.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Guide to DIY Draperies](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing3.PNG)\n</p>\n\nLining curtain panels is an economical measure you can take to enhance the practicality of draperies. In addition to filtering light, linings can also aide in lowering room temperature, adding body to lightweight fabrics and enhance privacy. \n\nNow you are ready to get starting sewing your perfect drapes!\n\n*Illustrations and photos created by <a href=\"http://www.lindseycrafter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsey Crafter</a>\n",

No piece work or pattern making required. </p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve determined the desired dimensions of your finished curtains, add 1” seam allowance to the bottom and sides of the panel and add an additional 3”+ inches to the top of your curtain panel to accommodate the width of your curtain rod (if using rod &amp; pocket method). Turn-under the raw edges ½” and turn over again to create a ½” fold. Press the edge and pin in place before sewing around the outside of the panel. Fold the top edge down 3” and test that your curtain rod can still pass through the channel before top stitching down the fold. This pocket will allow a rod to pass through to easily install in a window.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing1.PNG\" alt=\"Guide to DIY Draperies\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing2.PNG\" alt=\"Guide to DIY Draperies\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Guide%20to%20DIY%20Draperies/sewing3.PNG\" alt=\"Guide to DIY Draperies\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Lining curtain panels is an economical measure you can take to enhance the practicality of draperies. In addition to filtering light, linings can also aide in lowering room temperature, adding body to lightweight fabrics and enhance privacy. </p>\n\n<p>Now you are ready to get starting sewing your perfect drapes!</p>\n\n<p>*Illustrations and photos created by <a href=\"http://www.lindseycrafter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsey Crafter</a></p>",

However, the Spring/Summer runways are showing  a nod to more dramatic color and the larger scale buds from the 60s.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Spring Dress Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Spring%20Dress%20Refresh/IMG_4629-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0399836/art-gallery-skopelos-voile-nisi-flora-oceanon\">Art Gallery Skopelos Voile Nisi Flora Oceanon</a> is a great example of that look, but with the deep navy backdrop this floral looks very modern.

A new color is making its way onto the scene and it's the soft pastel hue of lavender.  As a possible alternative to Pantone's Color of the Year, Ultra-Violet, lavender has been all over the runways.   We've already seen a lot of hair and make-up in this color, so it only makes sense that it make it over to our clothing.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Spring Dress Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Spring%20Dress%20Refresh/IMG_4641-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou may not initially be enthralled with lavender and that's okay.  It's easy to see how the color on a garment could throw you back to the 1950's.  But you don't need to wear it all over to look stylish. This <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456731/cotton-steel-from-porto-with-love-rayon-challis-snack-time-lavander\">Cotton and Steel From Porto with Love Rayon Challis in Snack Time Lavender</a> was a great compromise.  While the background is a deeper blue-ish lavender, the cream storks balance out the color and adds some modern whimsy.\n\nYou can experiment with more pink undertones to the more blue undertones of lilac to see what goes with your personal style.  If you want to use lavender as a solid, selecting a more modern sewing pattern and silhouette will help you from feeling dated.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Spring Dress Refresh](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Spring%20Dress%20Refresh/cb-2651_blog_springDress_dress2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThe luxurious feel of rayon challis makes a great combination with the <a href=\"https://www.christinehaynes.com/products/sylvie-dress-pdf-pattern\">Sylvie dress by Christine Haynes</a>.  The waist has a great tailored shape and the gathered skirt allows the fabric to move well and swing.  An invisible zipper keeps the back nice and clean.  This is a great dress for all the baby and bridal showers and even an afternoon wedding.\n\nFor more Lavender options, see these fabrics:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476981/kaufman-fineline-twill-49-oz-lavender\">Robert Kaufman Fineline Twill</a> - Great mauve toned lavender which would be great for shorts, capris or more structured skirts.</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0412330/anna-maria-horner-loominous-illuminated-graph-plum\">Anna Maria Horner Loominous Illuminated Graph in Plum</a> - Textured woven with metallic thread for a special garment</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0390562/cotton-seersucker-stripe-lavender-white\">Cotton Seersucker Stripe in Lavender/White</a> - Classic summer fabric in this season's must have color - a perfect pairing!</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nHave fun refreshing your wardrobe this spring with some fun, trendy DIYs!\n\n",

A new color is making its way onto the scene and it's the soft pastel hue of lavender.  As a possible alternative to Pantone's Color of the Year, Ultra-Violet, lavender has been all over the runways.   We've already seen a lot of hair and make-up in this color, so it only makes sense that it make it over to our clothing.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Spring%20Dress%20Refresh/IMG_4641-min.jpg\" alt=\"Spring Dress Refresh\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>You may not initially be enthralled with lavender and that's okay.  It's easy to see how the color on a garment could throw you back to the 1950's.  But you don't need to wear it all over to look stylish. This <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0456731/cotton-steel-from-porto-with-love-rayon-challis-snack-time-lavander\">Cotton and Steel From Porto with Love Rayon Challis in Snack Time Lavender</a> was a great compromise.  While the background is a deeper blue-ish lavender, the cream storks balance out the color and adds some modern whimsy.</p>\n\n<p>You can experiment with more pink undertones to the more blue undertones of lilac to see what goes with your personal style.  If you want to use lavender as a solid, selecting a more modern sewing pattern and silhouette will help you from feeling dated.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Spring%20Dress%20Refresh/cb-2651_blog_springDress_dress2.jpg\" alt=\"Spring Dress Refresh\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The luxurious feel of rayon challis makes a great combination with the <a href=\"https://www.christinehaynes.com/products/sylvie-dress-pdf-pattern\">Sylvie dress by Christine Haynes</a>.  The waist has a great tailored shape and the gathered skirt allows the fabric to move well and swing.  An invisible zipper keeps the back nice and clean.  This is a great dress for all the baby and bridal showers and even an afternoon wedding.</p>\n\n<p>For more Lavender options, see these fabrics:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n     <li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0476981/kaufman-fineline-twill-49-oz-lavender\">Robert Kaufman Fineline Twill</a> - Great mauve toned lavender which would be great for shorts, capris or more structured skirts.</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0412330/anna-maria-horner-loominous-illuminated-graph-plum\">Anna Maria Horner Loominous Illuminated Graph in Plum</a> - Textured woven with metallic thread for a special garment</li>\n     <li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0390562/cotton-seersucker-stripe-lavender-white\">Cotton Seersucker Stripe in Lavender/White</a> - Classic summer fabric in this season's must have color - a perfect pairing!</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Have fun refreshing your wardrobe this spring with some fun, trendy DIYs!</p>",

Do not backstitch to lock stitches when starting OR stopping. After the two parallel rows have been sewn, separate the bobbin thread from the top thread. Tie off the top threads so they stay in place, and clip the top thread tails. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/face%20up-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nMeasure each fabric piece into equal fourths and pin the pieces together. Start on one end, holding both bobbin thread tails and slide the fabric towards the center. Repeat for the other side until the fabric is gathered to match the length of the joining fabric.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/gather%20each%20side-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nSliding the fabric along the bobbin thread is much easier than the top threads and will make for a cleaner seam finish.\n\nSet your machine settings back to normal and sew the seam allowance just past the gather rows. Adjust the ruffles as you go to keep them straight, and finish the seam when done.\nAnother way you can do the pull method is to sew the seam allowance in between the 2 parallel rows. The gathered fabric results are absolutely beautiful and it’s easier to sew to the joining fabric. An extra step is involved though – you must remove the lower gather stitch row afterwards since it’s outside the seam. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/sew%20in%20middle-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/remove%20thread-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Cord Method\nMedium to heavyweight fabrics can be too thick for the parallel row pull method. Instead, try the cord method for creating gathers. Sew a wide zig zag stitch instead – with yarn or cord in the middle to pull. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/cord%20method-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\nYou can get the cord there 1 of 2 ways – sew the zig zag stitch with the cord in the middle as you sew, or thread the cord through with a craft needle afterward.\n\nContinue as you would otherwise, pinning the fabric piece together, and then pulling the cord to gather the fabric until the lengths match.\n \nRemove the cord afterward, clip gathers to reduce bulk within the seam allowance, and finish the seam.\n\nIf you sew a lot of projects with gathered fabric, investing in a ruffle foot or gathering foot might be a good idea. They give much more uniformity to the gathers and can be a big time saver.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Gathers](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Gathers/cb-2587_gathers-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy gathering!\n\n",

Attach a strip of elastic on the underside the seam by using a zig zag stitch.  A little tip we like to use is cutting the elastic with an additional 2”, so that it stretch consistent all the way around the waistband, and no pre-joining elastic is required. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/finish%20sew%20elastic.JPG)\n</p>\n\nNext lay the seam allowance down, toward the skirt. Top stitch 3/8” around to enclose the elastic and secure the seam allowance. Sewing the waistband down on the skirt piece instead of the bodice piece gives much less risk for popping  the topstitch, since the bodice is usually more form fitting than the skirt piece. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/in%20machine.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Exposed Elastic Waist Seams\nExposed elastic waist seams are very common as well, and give a cleaner look. It requires less steps, but a tad more precision. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/exposed%20done.JPG)\n</p>\n\nStart by combining the bodice and skirt piece with a ¼” seam allowance. Attach the ¼” elastic strip with a zig zag stitch. \n\nWhen you sew the zig zag stitch- position it so that one point of the zig zag overedges the elastic, and the other point penetrates the elastic and meets the seam at the same time. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/zig%20zag%20seam.JPG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/seam%20edge.JPG)\n</p>\n\nHaving that little edge of fabric left on the seam allowance adds as a buffer between the elastic band edge and your skin, for a more comfortable fit. Otherwise an exposed elastic seam can be a little itchy. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Elastic Waist Seams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/cb-2586_elasticWaist2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\nHappy Sewing!\n",

Sewing the waistband down on the skirt piece instead of the bodice piece gives much less risk for popping  the topstitch, since the bodice is usually more form fitting than the skirt piece. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/in%20machine.JPG\" alt=\"Elastic Waist Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"exposedelasticwaistseams\">Exposed Elastic Waist Seams</h4>\n\n<p>Exposed elastic waist seams are very common as well, and give a cleaner look. It requires less steps, but a tad more precision. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/exposed%20done.JPG\" alt=\"Elastic Waist Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Start by combining the bodice and skirt piece with a ¼” seam allowance. Attach the ¼” elastic strip with a zig zag stitch. </p>\n\n<p>When you sew the zig zag stitch- position it so that one point of the zig zag overedges the elastic, and the other point penetrates the elastic and meets the seam at the same time. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/zig%20zag%20seam.JPG\" alt=\"Elastic Waist Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/seam%20edge.JPG\" alt=\"Elastic Waist Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Having that little edge of fabric left on the seam allowance adds as a buffer between the elastic band edge and your skin, for a more comfortable fit. Otherwise an exposed elastic seam can be a little itchy. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Elastic%20Waist%20Seams/cb-2586_elasticWaist2.jpg\" alt=\"Elastic Waist Seams\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Happy Sewing!</p>",

It includes everything in the tutorial below, along with a blank quilt printable of the design so you can plan colors and prints. </strong>\n\nYou'll be making 32 half-square triangles from the floral red and main white and 16 each of the yellow and the coral with the main white. To make a half square triangle, place a 5 1/8\" square of main white with a 5 1/8\" square of floral red, right sides together. Draw a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner with a marking pen on the wrong side of the fabric.\n\nSew a straight seam 1/4\" on either side of the marked line.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31862\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Half-Square-Triangle-1-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\nCut on the marked line with your rotary cutter to separate the two triangles. Open up the squares and press the seams to one side. Trim the square to 4 1/2\".\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31850\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Trimming-Half-Square-Triangles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1778\" />\n\nRepeat for all of the Red Floral, Yellow, and Main coral 5 1/8\" squares. You will have 64 Red and White squares, 32 Coral and White squares and 32 Yellow and White squares.\n\nBegin sewing your pieced blocks together. Start by sewing a red/white square to a coral/white square. Sew a yellow/white square to a red/white square. You'll now have 2 sets of two block rows. Press the center seams opposite directions. Place the two rows right sides together and sew together, matching the center seams. Press the seam to one side. Use the photo below for half square triangle alignment and directions.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31849\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sewing-Spring-Diamonds-Quilt-Blocks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1764\" />\n\nYour four squares should form a diamond of prints in the center with the main white floral on the outside of all of the triangles. Repeat this step to sew a total of 32 diamond blocks. The finished size of the blocks should be 8 1/2\".\n\nBegin to sew your rows together. For all of your diamonds, the red/pink side should be at the top of the block. Alternate a diamond block with an 8 1/2\" main white floral block. Row 1 should start with a diamond block.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31863\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Row-1-piecing-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"118\" />\n\nRow 2 should start with an unpieced block, then alternate the pieced and regular blocks.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31864\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Row-2-piecing-01-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"185\" />\n\nContinue for 6 more rows. You should have 4 rows that start with a diamond block and four that start with a plain block. Press the seams to one side, alternating the direction with each row.\n\nSew your rows together to form the center of the quilt.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31865\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Center-of-quilt-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"602\" />\n\nPress the row seams towards the bottom of the quilt.\n\nSew two of the red floral 1 1/2\" strips together to form a 1 1/2\" x 84\" strip. Repeat with the remaining strips to sew 3 more long strips. Press the seams to one side.\n\nSew one of each of the strips to the top and bottom of the quilt. Trim off the ends to line up with the center of the quilt. Sew the remaining two 1 1/2\" strips to the left and right sides of the quilt.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31866\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Red-Border-on-Quilt-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"602\" />\n\nRepeat for the larger coral border, sewing the strips together to form four long pieces, then sew the top and bottom border pieces, trimming, then the left and right border pieces.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31867\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Coral-Border-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"602\" />\n\nThis finishes your quilt top! Prepare your backing fabric (I used the Leaves Pink fabric as the backing) and quilt and bind as desired. Mine was quilted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Julies-Longarm-Quilting-Service-794549267317106/?ref=br_rs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Julie's Longarm Service.</a> I chose a pretty floral quilting design - I thought it looked great with the floral prints!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31869\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Spring-Diamonds-Quilt-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1388\" />\n\nOnce your quilt is quilted, bind it with the Gingham Pink print. I cut my binding straight (not on the bias) because I wanted the gingham to be at a diagonal. My strips were 2 1/2\" and I did double fold binding, sewn to the front and hand-stitched to the back. Feel free to bind it however you choose!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31868\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Spring-Diamonds-Quilt-Binding-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" />\n\nNow you can show off your sweet new quilt for Spring!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31852\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Spring-Diamonds-Quilt-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1836\" />",

Her charming designs for Michael Miller Fabrics are some of our favorites for creating quilts, apparel and so much more.\n\nLet's get to know <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/sarah-jane\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Jane</a>!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/hello%20about%20pic.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####About Sarah Jane\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/sarah-jane\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Jane</a> is a textile designer and children’s book illustrator, but most importantly, mother to 4 ambitious and creative children. From her love of childhood, her designs evoke the essence of childhood with simple, whimsical and almost nostalgic illustrations. With her motive of cultivating the wonder of childhood, Sarah Jane has built a business offering her embroidery designs, artwork, wallpaper and paper toys online as well as collaborations with Ralph Lauren, Paris Ritz, Land of Nod, among others. She has designed fabric for Michael Miller Fabrics for 7 years. \n\nMost recently, she and her husband have joined creative forces to become an author/illustrator team, creating the new children’s book series and character, LOLA DUTCH, which released in January of this year. Lola Dutch is a character who embodies curious and creative childhood and will be a multiple book series with book 2 and 3 coming soon! \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/sarah-jane\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Jane</a> and her husband live in the mountains of Utah with their 4 children.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/150323_SarahJaneStudios_406.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Q&A\n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for design?\n\nAs early as I can remember! I remember being 2-3 years old and being stunned by the color of the ocean in Hawaii where my mother is from. I can still see it in my mind! From then, I don’t remember a time where my hands weren’t holding a pencil, crayon, or creative utensil of some kind.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/150323_SarahJaneStudios_565.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\n\nSimple, charming, classic. \n\n####You partnered with Michael Miller to launch your line of fabrics. What made them the perfect partner for you?\n\nThey approached me, but I would have approached them first if I had the chance. I can’t imagine working with a better partner. They completely trust my design approach, they truly value creativity and exploration. And because they have a relatively small team for how big their market is, they are like a family: approachable, willing to explore new ideas, open to changing with the market, and the best part…they are a lot of fun! I have felt so supported in my design journey, and they have been 200% supportive, which as a designer is so paramount! \n\nMichael Miller is like a family to me. They have always been on top of market shifts, and in my opinion create some of the top quality product in the industry. Quality has always been their #1 and as an artist and designer, I’ve really truly appreciated that. But bottom line, they are just so much fun to work with, and so easy as a client. I’m truly grateful! \n\n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric or product that you’ve designed, what would it be and why? *Please select something sold on fabric.com\n\nHow could I choose one! If I had to choose one, I’d choose either “Magic Parade” because it’s so versatile, and depicts each one of my kids. Also, “Plockade”, which is Swedish for ‘gathered’ because it reminds me of my Grandmother of Scandinavian decent and her incredible love of being outside and gathering flowers.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/Magic_v1.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/Magic_v2.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####What are your current favorite trends in sewing / quilting? \n\nI love the low volume quilting trend as well as the trend towards simple classic clothing. I’m thrilled to see more clothing designs that aren’t about the complicated layers of clothing, but about the fabric quality, function and design. \n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)? \n\nI absolutely love watching others be creative with my creative offering. To see sewers use my fabric as an inspiration to inspire their own creative projects is incredible! Little girl dresses and bedroom décor are probably the #1 creation used with my fabric, and so I absolutely love seeing mothers and grandmothers sew for their children and decorate their rooms with my designs! I love witnessing that creative process between mother and child, grandparent and -grandchild. It’s so incredibly fulfilling. I’m very involved on Instagram and Facebook, and when people share their projects and their personal stories behind them, it’s incredible. I’ve heard stories that have brought me to tears, and it makes what I do so worth it. \n\n\n####What projects are on your “must make” list right now? \n\nI am currently making (well, someone else is making them, because I’m not the best seamstress) some lovely vintage dresses as well as some new quilts for my kids. I’m working on my next collection, and I’m redoing my kids rooms with the new designs! They are pretty lucky that they get new bedding and clothing every season it seems! \n\n####What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most? \n\nI mostly look to my favorite designers from the past for inspiration. I absolutely adore the French Textile Designer Paule Marrot, illustrators Virginia Lee Burton, Ludwig Bemelmens and Gyo Fujikawa. \n\n\n####What’s coming up for you in 2018? What’s next? \n\n2018 has been so full already! I’ve just finished illustrating the second book in the Lola Dutch Series, and I’m finishing up the 3rd. I’m releasing a new Fabric Line, Peter Pan, this summer with Michael Miller Fabrics and will be launching another fabric line soon after that! 2018 already feels like it’s over with how much we are producing this year, but it’s all so much fun. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/150323_SarahJaneStudios_480.jpg)\n</p> \n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating? \n\nJust being with Kenneth, my husband, and the kids. It doesn’t matter where we are, we just absolutely love spending time together. \n\n\n####Tell us one thing people might not know about you: \n\nI’m horrible at science (flunked physical science in college…twice), but I got an A in Honors Chemistry in high school because my final research paper was on the chemical reaction between paint and the fresco process during the Renaissance, a topic which I am pretty sure the teacher was clueless about, but the only thing that excited me about chemistry...which was a stretch…but it got me an A and it taught me the most invaluable lesson: if your curious about it, and truly love it, you will go far.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Sarah Jane](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/CB-2676_blog_sarahJane_projects.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/sarah-jane\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all of Sarah Jane's collections!\n \n\n",

From then, I don’t remember a time where my hands weren’t holding a pencil, crayon, or creative utensil of some kind.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/150323_SarahJaneStudios_565.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"describeyouraestheticin3words\">Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.</h4>\n\n<p>Simple, charming, classic. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"youpartneredwithmichaelmillertolaunchyourlineoffabricswhatmadethemtheperfectpartnerforyou\">You partnered with Michael Miller to launch your line of fabrics. What made them the perfect partner for you?</h4>\n\n<p>They approached me, but I would have approached them first if I had the chance. I can’t imagine working with a better partner. They completely trust my design approach, they truly value creativity and exploration. And because they have a relatively small team for how big their market is, they are like a family: approachable, willing to explore new ideas, open to changing with the market, and the best part…they are a lot of fun! I have felt so supported in my design journey, and they have been 200% supportive, which as a designer is so paramount! </p>\n\n<p>Michael Miller is like a family to me. They have always been on top of market shifts, and in my opinion create some of the top quality product in the industry. Quality has always been their #1 and as an artist and designer, I’ve really truly appreciated that. But bottom line, they are just so much fun to work with, and so easy as a client. I’m truly grateful! </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ifyouhadtochooseonefavoritefabricorproductthatyouvedesignedwhatwoulditbeandwhypleaseselectsomethingsoldonfabriccom\">If you had to choose one favorite fabric or product that you’ve designed, what would it be and why? *Please select something sold on fabric.com</h4>\n\n<p>How could I choose one! If I had to choose one, I’d choose either “Magic Parade” because it’s so versatile, and depicts each one of my kids. Also, “Plockade”, which is Swedish for ‘gathered’ because it reminds me of my Grandmother of Scandinavian decent and her incredible love of being outside and gathering flowers.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/Magic_v1.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane\" />\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/Magic_v2.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"whatareyourcurrentfavoritetrendsinsewingquilting\">What are your current favorite trends in sewing / quilting?</h4>\n\n<p>I love the low volume quilting trend as well as the trend towards simple classic clothing. I’m thrilled to see more clothing designs that aren’t about the complicated layers of clothing, but about the fabric quality, function and design. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatdoyoulovemostaboutcreatingadiyprojectwithyourfabricorseeingcustomerscreatingdiyprojectswithyourfabric\">What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?</h4>\n\n<p>I absolutely love watching others be creative with my creative offering. To see sewers use my fabric as an inspiration to inspire their own creative projects is incredible! Little girl dresses and bedroom décor are probably the #1 creation used with my fabric, and so I absolutely love seeing mothers and grandmothers sew for their children and decorate their rooms with my designs! I love witnessing that creative process between mother and child, grandparent and -grandchild. It’s so incredibly fulfilling. I’m very involved on Instagram and Facebook, and when people share their projects and their personal stories behind them, it’s incredible. I’ve heard stories that have brought me to tears, and it makes what I do so worth it. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatprojectsareonyourmustmakelistrightnow\">What projects are on your “must make” list right now?</h4>\n\n<p>I am currently making (well, someone else is making them, because I’m not the best seamstress) some lovely vintage dresses as well as some new quilts for my kids. I’m working on my next collection, and I’m redoing my kids rooms with the new designs! They are pretty lucky that they get new bedding and clothing every season it seems! </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatotherblogsbrandsdesignersinspireyoumost\">What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?</h4>\n\n<p>I mostly look to my favorite designers from the past for inspiration. I absolutely adore the French Textile Designer Paule Marrot, illustrators Virginia Lee Burton, Ludwig Bemelmens and Gyo Fujikawa. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatscomingupforyouin2018whatsnext\">What’s coming up for you in 2018? What’s next?</h4>\n\n<p>2018 has been so full already! I’ve just finished illustrating the second book in the Lola Dutch Series, and I’m finishing up the 3rd. I’m releasing a new Fabric Line, Peter Pan, this summer with Michael Miller Fabrics and will be launching another fabric line soon after that! 2018 already feels like it’s over with how much we are producing this year, but it’s all so much fun. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/150323_SarahJaneStudios_480.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane\" />\n</p> \n\n<h4 id=\"whatdoyoulovetodowhenyouarentdesigningandcreating\">What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?</h4>\n\n<p>Just being with Kenneth, my husband, and the kids. It doesn’t matter where we are, we just absolutely love spending time together. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tellusonethingpeoplemightnotknowaboutyou\">Tell us one thing people might not know about you:</h4>\n\n<p>I’m horrible at science (flunked physical science in college…twice), but I got an A in Honors Chemistry in high school because my final research paper was on the chemical reaction between paint and the fresco process during the Renaissance, a topic which I am pretty sure the teacher was clueless about, but the only thing that excited me about chemistry...which was a stretch…but it got me an A and it taught me the most invaluable lesson: if your curious about it, and truly love it, you will go far.  </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%3A%20Sarah%20Jane/CB-2676_blog_sarahJane_projects.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jane\" />\n</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/sarah-jane\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all of Sarah Jane's collections!</p>",

We used super soft <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/dg-555/shannon-minky-cuddle-dimple-blush\" target=\"_blank\">Minky</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/embrace-double-gauze\" target=\"_blank\">Embrace Double Gauze</a> from Shannon Fabrics to create this blanket, but you can use any soft material for yours.

The Minky will create a wide border on the edges of our blanket. You can make any sizes you’d like with as wide or small of a border as you’d like, by playing around with the dimensions of the cut pieces. If you make a blanket larger than 54” square, we recommend tacking the front and back together a few times at regular intervals to keep them together.\n\nFirst, cut your Minky fabric into a 45” square. You can leave the selvedge on, it will not show on the finished blanket. The easiest way to do this is to ensure your edges are straight and fold into a 45 degree angle to cut.\n\nCut your gauze fabric into a 35” square using the same method.\n\nOn the wrong side of the Minky fabric, with your ruler and marking tool, mark a line 4.5” from the corner as shown. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/45.PNG)\n</p>\n\n*Tip – if you are using your own dimensions, take the width of your border and take out ½” for your own corner measurements.\n\nCut these marked corners off.\n\n####Sewing Instructions\n\nFold your minky to the wrong side of the fabric ½” and pin. This will ensure that you have nice finished binding on your self binding blanket. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/100.PNG)\n</p>\n\nFold your corner right sides together and sew at a ½” seam allowance. Make sure these are VERY accurate, it will affect your finished results!\nRepeat this for all four corners.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/138.PNG)\n</p>\n\nFlip all corners out  - almost done!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/152.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTuck your gauze piece into all the corners, it should fit exactly. Make sure this is flat so your finished blanket isn’t bunched. Pin in place.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/205.PNG)\n</p>\n\nPin down your binding on top of the gauze with a ½” fold under all the way around.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/215.PNG)\n</p>\n\nTopstitch the binding in place about ¼” from the inside edge. You can also use a blanket or zig zag stitch for this. A walking foot is essential for even binding.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Self Binding Baby Blanket](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Self%20Binding%20Baby%20Blanket/blanket1.jpg)\n</p>",

We'll tell you everything you need to know about selecting the right outdoor textile for your desired durability, price and design aesthetic.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EjIEPB-pV0Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Select Fabrics Labeled for Outdoor Use\nStart by selecting fabrics labeled for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">outdoor</a> use. These fabrics have been specially treated for resistance to water, stains, UV and other outside elements.\n\nFabric.com has a wide variety of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">outdoor fabrics</a> to choose from, but today we will talk about some of the most common outdoor fabrics, their benefits and what projects they are best suited for.\n\n#####Some of the most common fabric groups to look for in outdoor use are:\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=polyester-or-polyester-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=acrylic-or-acrylic-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Solution-dyed Acrylic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=olefin-or-olefin-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Solution-dyed Olefin</a> \n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=mesh&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Mesh</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=marine-vinyl\" target=\"_blank\">Marine Vinyl</a>\n\n\n####Consider Desired Durability and Price\nWhen selecting fabric for your outdoor project, one important item to consider is how durable you’d like your project to be. If a wider selection of prints and styles, along with a lower price, is most important to you, then look for products labeled for outdoor use which are <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=polyester-or-polyester-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Polyester-based Outdoor fabrics</a> such as:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0419476/richloom-indoor-outdoor-remi-palm\" target=\"_blank\"> Richloom Indoor/Outdoor Remi Palm</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0437677/tommy-bahama-indoor-outdoor-island-hopping-emerald\" target=\"_blank\">Tommy Bahama Indoor/Outdoor Island Hopping Emerald</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0333364/richloom-solarium-outdoor-fresca-fiesta\" target=\"_blank\"> Richloom Solarium Outdoor Fresca Fiesta</a>\n\nThese fabrics are typically medium weight, easy to sew with, and come in a wide variety of prints and styles. Many are UV treated for an average of only 500 light hours before fading occurs, so they should be brought indoors when not in use. They can be easily cleaned with warm water and mild soapy solution. These fabrics are perfect for adding a personal touch to an outdoor space with pillows or light upholstery.\n\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/Poly%20fabrics-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n\nIf you’re looking for something more durable that you won’t have to worry about bringing indoors during those long summer days, look for products labeled for outdoor use which are either <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=acrylic-or-acrylic-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Solution-dyed Acrylic</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fiber-content-range=olefin-or-olefin-blends&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Solution-dyed Olefin</a>  fabrics. These fabrics will provide more durability over polyester-based fabrics and can withstand the long hours of direct summer sunlight. Some of our favorites are:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0568622/sunbrella-blend-mistbasketweave\" target=\"_blank\"> Sunbrella Blend Mist Basketweave</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0336351/sunbrella-outdoor-dupione-papaya\" target=\"_blank\"> Sunbrella Outdoor Dupione Papaya</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0297758/sunbrella-outdoor-canvas-stripe-seville-seaside\" target=\"_blank\"> Sunbrella Outdoor Canvas Stripe Seville Seaside</a>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/Acrylic%20olefin%20fabrics-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\nThese fabrics range from medium to very heavyweight canvas or jacquard-style fabrics made for durability. Although very limited in prints, these fabrics get their color from solution dyed fibers before they are spun into fabric, drastically reducing any fading from UV rays.  This fiber is often used for outdoor awnings, umbrellas and covers. These fabrics have a higher abrasion resistance (stated in double-rubs) as well, making them perfect for outdoor upholstery, cushions and pillows. Although these fabrics are made to resist the outdoor elements, they should still be brought under cover when not in use to help prolong the life of your project. The price points are usually higher than Polyester fabrics, but for good reason.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/AdobeStock_100414669-min.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nOne common approach is to mix both of these fabric types together. Utilize acrylic fabrics for your solids which will last much longer, and add Polyester fabrics to add that personal touch to your outdoor space.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/iStock-104230539-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Heavy Duty Outdoor Projects\nNow let’s talk about more heavy duty outdoor fabrics. If you are working on a project such as poolside or patio chairs, look for fabrics labeled as <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=mesh&usage=outdoor\" target=\"_blank\">PVC Mesh</a>. PVC Mesh fabric is commonly used in sling-style outdoor furniture - pool chairs and patio chairs that have a plastic-like basket weave appearance. Water can pass through them, they dry quickly, and most are fade resistant. Because PVC mesh doesn’t stretch, they don’t require any cushioning underneath for support- it can be simply attached to a metal or wood furniture frame.

The most durable of the outdoor fabrics we are covering today, marine vinyl has been treated for water, stain and UV resistance and has a high abrasion resistance as well. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/Marine%20vinyl%20fabrics-min.PNG)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Outdoor Fabric](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20the%20Perfect%20Outdoor%20Fabric/AdobeStock_107078610-min.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nMarine vinyl typically has a leather-look and can be used for boat or automotive upholstery, but can also be used indoors for high-traffic upholstery for home or commercial use.

Like many other designers at Riley Blake, she is a teacher turned stay-at-home mom who discovered illustration while searching for a hobby to maintain her sanity at home with two little children.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/zDSC04682_edit-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nRachel comes from a long line of seamstresses who she constantly disappoints with her aversion to \"measuring twice, cutting once.\" Illustrating is her passion. She is drawn to bright colors and a hand-drawn whimsical style, though she has to remind herself often that not everyone loves orange as much as she does.\n\nWhen she isn't illustrating, you can find her sipping diet coke while playing \"kitty tornado water slide\" with her son (don't ask), drawing baby animals with her daughter (mostly kitties), or combing the beach for more tiny shells and shark teeth to add to her borderline obsessive collection.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/DSC04529%20crop-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n\n####Q&A\n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for design?\n \nI’ve always loved to create and collect art. I come from a long line of creative matriarchs who crave to make things beautiful, each in their own way.  My grandma is a watercolor artist and taught me the basics of art. My mother is an interior designer and taught me the basics of aesthetics and design. I knew how to pick out good art; however I was always frustrated because I didn’t have the skills or tools to create what I saw in my head.  Then after I quit my job to stay home with my first child, I discovered Adobe Illustrator and everything clicked. I finally found the medium that allows me to express my ideas in the way that I want them expressed.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/DSC04623-min.jpg)\n</p>\n \n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/answer%202.png)\n</p>\n \n####Your newest collections Lancelot and Guinevere are now available on fabric.com! What was the inspiration behind these collections?\n \nI came up with this idea 4 years ago, before I ever thought about designing fabric. My daughter was 3 years old and obsessed with princesses.

Like many other designers at Riley Blake, she is a teacher turned stay-at-home mom who discovered illustration while searching for a hobby to maintain her sanity at home with two little children.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/zDSC04682_edit-min.jpg\" alt=\"Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>Rachel comes from a long line of seamstresses who she constantly disappoints with her aversion to \"measuring twice, cutting once.\" Illustrating is her passion. She is drawn to bright colors and a hand-drawn whimsical style, though she has to remind herself often that not everyone loves orange as much as she does.</p>\n\n<p>When she isn't illustrating, you can find her sipping diet coke while playing \"kitty tornado water slide\" with her son (don't ask), drawing baby animals with her daughter (mostly kitties), or combing the beach for more tiny shells and shark teeth to add to her borderline obsessive collection.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/DSC04529%20crop-min.jpg\" alt=\"Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"qa\">Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"whendidyourealizeyouhadapassionfordesign\">When did you realize you had a passion for design?</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve always loved to create and collect art. I come from a long line of creative matriarchs who crave to make things beautiful, each in their own way.  My grandma is a watercolor artist and taught me the basics of art. My mother is an interior designer and taught me the basics of aesthetics and design. I knew how to pick out good art; however I was always frustrated because I didn’t have the skills or tools to create what I saw in my head.  Then after I quit my job to stay home with my first child, I discovered Adobe Illustrator and everything clicked. I finally found the medium that allows me to express my ideas in the way that I want them expressed.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/DSC04623-min.jpg\" alt=\"Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"describeyouraestheticin3words\">Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.</h4>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Citrus%20and%20Mint/answer%202.png\" alt=\"Designer Spotlight Citrus and Mint\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"yournewestcollectionslancelotandguineverearenowavailableonfabriccomwhatwastheinspirationbehindthesecollections\">Your newest collections Lancelot and Guinevere are now available on fabric.com!

Seersucker is an easy fabric to work with because it’s very stable. This is a great choice of fabric if it’s your first adventure with a button-up and collared shirt. We also chose these seersucker fabrics because they are ideal for the summer since they’re very lightweight. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/0302142.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/DJ-435.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTwo other great alternative fabric options for a collared shirt are <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-oxford\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Oxford</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/liberty-fabrics-saville-poplin\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Fabrics Poplin</a>.\n\n####Supplies Needed\n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric-shirting-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Shirting fabric</a> (determine yardage according to size and pattern requirements)\n* Collared shirt pattern: We used the Fairfield Button-up by Thread Theory\n* Glue Stick\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/notions-patterns.aspx?product-type=buttons\" target=\"_blank\">Buttons</a>\n\n#### Glue your Pockets on\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nThis tip is a game changer and can be used on many projects! \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/G1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n1. Get any washable glue stick (basic Elmer's will work). Don’t worry about it being purple upon application. It will all wash out.\n2. Once your pockets are prepped and seam allowances are ironed according to pattern directions, glue around the edges of the entire pocket on the wrong side of the fabric.\n3. Carefully place and press the pocket into place. Now it won’t move, and there’s no need to pin! I find this method MUCH more accurate than pinning when I want to match a pocket perfectly. Also, try this method to match side seams. \n\n\n#### Reinforce the yoke\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/YA-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nA rip or tear along the yoke seam of a button-up shirt is common! This is where the most pressure is put on the garment as it is worn.  Try this tip to strengthen your seam and save yourself mending time down the road. \n\n1) Shorten your stitch length as you attach the yokes to the shirt back. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/Y1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n2) Strengthen the seam with a second row of stitching, approximately ¼ inch away. \n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/Y2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n3) Finally, iron and topstitch the yoke. \n\n#### Attach buttons with your sewing machine\n\nI don’t have the button sew-on foot for my Bernina, but I used my buttonhole foot and it worked just fine.  Any presser foot that allows a zigzag stitch can be used for sewing on buttons. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n1) Change your machine settings:\na.\tStich Width: 3-4\nb.\tStitch Length: 0\nc.\tNeedle Position: left\nd.\tFeed Control: lowered\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n2) Place your fabric and button under the foot and lower the needle into the left buttonhole. Lower your foot.\n\n3) The zigzag stitch width is almost always between 3-4 because the distance between holes on a button is standard. Decorative buttons are an exception to this rule.\n\n4) Adjust the zigzag and make a trial stitch by turning the hand wheel. Warning: if you hit the button going quickly, your button will likely break in half.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B3-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n5) Once you have the distance figured out, use the pedal to sew the button on.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![Mens Shirt Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B4-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n6) To finish, raise the needle. Set the zigzag width to 0 and sew a few fastening stitches in place. You’re done!\n\nExpert Tip: If you want a looser button, place a needle between the buttonholes (on top of your button) while sewing. \n\n\n#### Attaching a Collar\nWant to learn how to attach a collar with ease?

Now it won’t move, and there’s no need to pin! I find this method MUCH more accurate than pinning when I want to match a pocket perfectly. Also, try this method to match side seams. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"reinforcetheyoke\">Reinforce the yoke</h4>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/YA-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>A rip or tear along the yoke seam of a button-up shirt is common! This is where the most pressure is put on the garment as it is worn.  Try this tip to strengthen your seam and save yourself mending time down the road. </p>\n\n<p>1) Shorten your stitch length as you attach the yokes to the shirt back. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/Y1-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>2) Strengthen the seam with a second row of stitching, approximately ¼ inch away. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/Y2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>3) Finally, iron and topstitch the yoke. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"attachbuttonswithyoursewingmachine\">Attach buttons with your sewing machine</h4>\n\n<p>I don’t have the button sew-on foot for my Bernina, but I used my buttonhole foot and it worked just fine.  Any presser foot that allows a zigzag stitch can be used for sewing on buttons. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B1-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>  \n\n<p>1) Change your machine settings: <br />\na.    Stich Width: 3-4 <br />\nb.    Stitch Length: 0 <br />\nc.    Needle Position: left <br />\nd.    Feed Control: lowered</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B2-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>2) Place your fabric and button under the foot and lower the needle into the left buttonhole. Lower your foot.</p>\n\n<p>3) The zigzag stitch width is almost always between 3-4 because the distance between holes on a button is standard. Decorative buttons are an exception to this rule.</p>\n\n<p>4) Adjust the zigzag and make a trial stitch by turning the hand wheel. Warning: if you hit the button going quickly, your button will likely break in half.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B3-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>5) Once you have the distance figured out, use the pedal to sew the button on.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Mens%20Shirt%20Basics/B4-min.jpg\" alt=\"Mens Shirt Basics\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>6) To finish, raise the needle. Set the zigzag width to 0 and sew a few fastening stitches in place. You’re done!</p>\n\n<p>Expert Tip: If you want a looser button, place a needle between the buttonholes (on top of your button) while sewing. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"attachingacollar\">Attaching a Collar</h4>\n\n<p>Want to learn how to attach a collar with ease?

The finishing touches on any project secure the construction of the piece as well as provide a clean, functional finished look. Watch the video below for the full tutorial!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HbDXa2f2doY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<i>Tip: Always press a hem before and after sewing for easy stitching and a clean finish. If you’re concerned that the fold of the hem will indent the face fabric once ironed, use a press cloth. </i>\n\n####Topstitch Hem\nIn this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-brussels-washer-linen-blend\" target=\"_blank\">Kaufman Brussels Washer Linen Blend</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0312560/kaufman-brussels-washer-linen-blend-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">Ocean</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hem Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Hem%20Basics%20Wovens/topstitch.PNG)\n</p>\n\nThe most basic of hems, the topstitch hem is commonly used on a variety of projects including draperies, bedding, slacks, shorts, dresses, skirts, and outerwear. \n\nThe key to this hem is just making sure the rough edge is secured in some way, whether it’s folding it under, cut with a pinked edge, overlock stitched or serged. \n\nPick your desired length and determine the extra fabric needed for the desired hem-length. For example, if you’re making a skirt, and you want the skirt bottom to finish at 23”, add 1” for a 1” topstitched hem, or 1 ¼” for a 1” hem with ¼” folded under. \n\n####Narrow Hem\nFor this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=cotton-steel&fabric-type=lawn\" target=\"_blank\">Cotton + Steel Lawn</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0539806/cotton-steel-solid-lawn-toy-boat\" target=\"_blank\">Toy Boat</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hem Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Hem%20Basics%20Wovens/narrow.PNG)\n</p>\n\nJust as common as the topstitch hem, this hem essentially is a top stitch, but with a very narrow fold. This hem is perfect to use for subtle hems that you don’t want to add too much attention to, or delicate fabrics that won’t support a wider hem well, like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/weight/very-lightweight\" target=\"_blank\">very lightweight</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/product-features/sheer\" target=\"_blank\">sheer fabrics</a>.\n\nYou can achieve this hem in 1 of 2 ways: Simply fold the fabric under twice ¼” each time, press and top stitch.\n\nOr, if the fabric does not cooperate easily with a double fold, edge stitch a wide fold first, trim excess fabric to 1/8”, the fold again to topstitch a ¼” narrow hem. This technique works really well with alteration hemming since it can easily accommodate excess fabric in the first step.\n\n####Hand Whipstitch\nFor this example, we used <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-lush-velveteen\" target=\"_blank\"> Kaufman Lush Velveteen</a> in <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0416172/kaufman-lush-velveteen-royal\" target=\"_blank\">Royal</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hem Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Hem%20Basics%20Wovens/hand.PNG)\n</p>\n\nSometimes hand hemming works better than machine sewing for fabrics that have a lot of movement during sewing, embellished fabrics with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/product-features/sequins\" target=\"_blank\">sequins</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/product-features/dimensional\" target=\"_blank\">dimensional</a> design,  or plush/lofty fabrics that would show obvious stitches like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/fabric-type/velvet\" target=\"_blank\">velvet</a>, <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/fabric-type/faux-fur\" target=\"_blank\">faux fur</a> or <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/fabric-type/minky\" target=\"_blank\">minky</a>.\n\nLike the topstitch hem, a very important aspect to this stitch is making sure the edge is finished first- either by serging, overlocking or folding under. \n\nWith a hand needle and thread, carefully stitch the hem fabric to the back of the face fabric, by catching just a few threads to secure. Repeat this about every 3/8” along the hemline. The result is virtually an invisible stitch from the front, and a hemming experience that give you ultimate control. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hem Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Hem%20Basics%20Wovens/hand_catch.PNG)\n</p>\n\nHappy hemming! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop fabric.com's wide selection of fabrics</a> for your next project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Hem Basics](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Sewing%20101%3A%20Hem%20Basics%20Wovens/all_hems.PNG)\n</p>\n",

Find out what sewing projects are inspiring them, their favorite fabrics in their <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=scott-living&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Living fabric collection</a> and some fun facts that may surprise you!\n\n####About The Scott Brothers\nMulti-faceted entrepreneurs, best-selling authors and twin television personalities, Drew and Jonathan Scott are co-founders of Scott Brothers Global, which includes Scott Living and Scott Brothers Entertainment. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/Drew%20and%20Jonathan%20Scott%20Living%20Fabrics-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nScott Living is Jonathan and Drew’s rapidly expanding collection of home goods, which includes indoor furniture, décor, textiles and bedding.The Scott brothers are hosts of multiple top-rated HGTV series including the Emmy-nominated and Canadian Screen Award-winning Property Brothers, Brother vs. Brother and Property Brothers at Home, among others. Their shows are enjoyed by millions of viewers in over 150 countries and their books, Dream Home and It Takes Two: Our Story, are New York Times and Wall Street Journal best sellers. In 2017, the brothers were named Habitat Humanitarians, the highest recognition offered by Habitat for Humanity. \n\n####Q&A \n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for design?\nJONATHAN: When we were young, probably about five or six years old, we used to rearrange all the furniture in the house whenever Mom and Dad left us with a babysitter. We always had ideas about how to improve or freshen things up. And when I performed as a magician, I also learned woodworking and metalworking in order to build illusions. But it wasn’t until we graduated from high school that we decided to get into investing in real estate. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/Scott%20Living%20Fabrics%201-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\nDREW: smart, clean, character \n\nJONATHAN: cozy, elegantly eclectic \n\n####You partnered with Premier Prints to launch your line of fabrics. What made them the perfect partner for you?\nDREW: We strongly believe in finding partners who raise the bar like we do. We love working with people who love to work. Premier Prints brings great ideas and excellent quality to our venture. \n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric or product that you’ve designed, what would it be and why? \nJONATHAN: Our <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0581574/scott-living-canal-luxe-linen-basketweave-vermillion\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Living Canal Luxe Linen Basketweave Vermillion Fabric </a>\n is the right amount of everything. A beautiful, deep pop of red can add a little edge to any project. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/0581574.jpg)\n</p>\n\nDREW: I really like the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/scott-living-style-dome\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Living Dome Fabric</a> we offer in our collection. It’s simple and approachable but still elegant. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/0517565.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in sewing / DIY?\nJONATHAN: You still can’t beat making custom, full-height drapes and similar pillows. It’s an excellent way to tie a color or pattern throughout the space. \n\nDREW: My wife, Linda, has been making reusable cloth bags with our fabrics so that we don’t need to waste plastic. I love them, and they look great. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/20170729-IMG_8540%20%282%29-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nJONATHAN: I just love seeing people get creative. Sewing projects are very rewarding because you can get a high-end custom look and it’s not that difficult to pull off if you have the right equipment. Not to mention, you can brag about it every time somebody comes to the house!\n\n####What projects are on your “must make” list right now?\nJONATHAN: I am making my pups, Gracie and Stewie, their own custom beds right now. Who says the pooches can’t rock a little style too? \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/20170729-IMG_8386%20%282%29-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What’s coming up for you in 2018? What’s next?\nDREW: We’re filming Property Brothers and Buying & Selling in Nashville right now. Other than the extreme humidity, we’re having a blast. You’ll see a lot of incredible properties, and with each design you’ll see at least one completely unique feature. Stay tuned!\n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?\nJONATHAN: I love to crank the music and surround myself with inspiration—sometimes that’s other designers, sometimes it’s a beautiful atmosphere. When diving headfirst into the creative process, no idea is a bad one because any idea could lead to a gem. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/Photo%20Feb%2019%2C%2011%2054%2033%20AM-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n#### Tell us one thing people might not know about you.\nDREW: I actually went to college for kinesiology. I wanted to be a phys ed teacher or a personal trainer. \n\nJONATHAN: I’m a magician/illusionist and actually took costuming while attending the University of Calgary. I used to sew all my own costumes, curtains and props!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Scott%20Brothers/ScottLiving_218-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=scott-living&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop the entire collection of Scott Living fabrics on fabric.com!</a>\n",

I typically look for a Nylon Spandex blend with 4-way stretch. You will want to use high quality fabric with coverage. Nylon/Spandex blends are versatile for swim and athletic wear. \n\nPrints like this retro gingham and floral print inspire me to want to make my own Swimwear! You will also want to add a liner fabric suited for swimwear to the bottoms and the bust area. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/equipment%201-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/equipment%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Use the Right Equipment\nSerger: I am using my Brother Strong & Tough Serger and my Brother SE1900 Sewing and Embroidery Machine.\n\nIt's ideal to have a serger but not necessary. A sewing machine will do just fine. I usually combine both my serger and my sewing machine. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/zigzag%20and%20serge-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI use the sewing machine to sew the pieces together and the serger to clean up the seam allowance. I find it easier to sew first due to the slippery nature of nylon/spandex materials. Plus if I have a mishap it’s easier unpicking than an overlock stitch. \n\n####Choosing a Pattern:\nThere are plenty of options for swimsuit patterns. I wanted a one piece and went with the Alison Swimsuit from Burda Style. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/pattern%20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/pattern%20cutting%20-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/pattern%20cutting%202-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/all%20the%20pieces%20cut%20out-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhen working with stretchy fabrics like spandex/nylon/polyester (or any knit for that matter), I use pattern weights, a rotary cutter, and mat to cut the pattern out. It's much easier this way, saves time, and great for slippery, stretchy materials like <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric-swimwear-shop.aspx?sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">swimwear fabric</a>.\n\n<i>*Tip: if you’re having trouble with the material shifting, try cutting the pattern piece 1 layer at a time (don’t use folds). You may have to draft the other side or print out 2 sets but it will be worth it!</i>\n\n####Machine Setup\nYou will want to use a ball point needle when sewing with spandex/knit fabrics or you may get skipped stitches. \n\nYou will also sew with a zigzag stitch when using your sewing machine or a special stretch stitch that some machines have. I prefer a basic zigzag that is 2.0 wide and 2.5 length. This always does the trick for me. \n\nFor finishing, I recommend using a twin needle. It has the finish similar of a Cover Stitch machine and a professional result. \n\nIf using a serger just make sure to test out on the same fabric to get the tension dials correct before the final project. \n\n\n####Use a Walking Foot\nThis is a bigger foot, and may take some extra steps to secure but is worth it for sewing knits and stretchy materials. The walking foot is a moving feed system that holds and moves fabric between the presser foot's upper feed go and the machine's lower feed dogs to better control difficult fabrics (like knits/spandex/etc) as well as multiple layers of fabric. It came in handy when sewing the thicker layers of the spandex binding along the swimsuit edge. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/walking%20foot-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Tips for Construction\nMost Swimwear is sewn with a 1/4\" seam allowance- follow your pattern instructions for this. You most likely will be adding elastic leg bands which will keep the leg openings nice and tight around your legs. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/construction%201-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI like to add cups for additional support and coverage in my swimsuits. Follow that pattern instructions for these. I typically insert them in the bodice during construction. Then once I try the suit on for final fitting, I’ll pin them into proper placement and baste stitch them by hand on the back side (liner). \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/leg%20band%20collage-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFor the leg bands you will want to use elastic. I am using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0371992/cotton-swimwear-elastic-3-8x2yd-natural\" target=\"_blank\">Dritz 3/8\" elastic</a>.\n\n* Measure the opening and subtract 1\". This will be the measurement you will want to cut the elastic to equal. Or refer to your pattern measurements. \n* Sew the elastic in a loop with a 1/2\" over lap using a zigzag stitch.\n* Measure and mark off the quarters on both the leg opening and the elastic. \n* Pin the the elastic to the wrong side of the leg opening matching the quarter marks. \n* Sew with elastic on top using a zigzag (2.5 length 2.0 wide) close to the outer edge of the elastic (about 1/16 from the edge). As you sew pull the elastic to meet each quarter mark.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/fold%20over%20elastic%20hem-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nNow turn over the fold. \n\nTop stitch the fold into place about 1/4\" from the edge or a little less than your elastic width. (make sure your getting the edge of the elastic). As you sew, pull, but also make sure the fabric is running perpendicular and flat or it will wave at the hem.\n\nWe hope this post inspires you to try sewing your own swimwear! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric-swimwear-shop.aspx?sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop swimwear fabric on fabric.com</a>. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Tips for Swimwear](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Tips%20for%20Sewing%20Swimwear/Main%20swim-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n",

Linen is one of the most breathable and absorbent fabrics, ideal for hot temperatures.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Fabric 101 Linen](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Fabric%20101%20Linen/iStock-696921522-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nEasy to sew with, <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/fiber-content-range/100percent-linen\" target=\"_blank\">linen</a> is an ultra-versatile fabric that can be used in home décor, fashion and even quilting. Watch the video below to learn more!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5f7PSE-HYVY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLinen is one of the strongest and most durable natural fibers – the ancient Egyptians used linen for mummification, and the US uses it blended with cotton for dollar bills! <a href=\" https://www.fabric.com/fiber-content-range/100percent-linen\" target=\"_blank\">Linen</a> fabric is usually a low-thread count even-weave cloth or sometimes <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?fabric-type=knit&fiber-content-range=linen-or-linen-blends\" target=\"_blank\">knit</a>.

This will help you know where the different colors go and how to sew everything together. I also recommend having a rotary cutter and mat for cutting out your squares. The process will go much quicker and be  more accurate than cutting them out by hand.\n\nAll the pieces for the quilt are cut at 2 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" squares. Cut your fabric into 2 1/2\" strips, then cut those strips into 2 1/2\" squares.\n\nCut the fabrics into the following number of squares:\n\nWhite Tiny Floral - 160 (top of camper)\nWhite Solid - 37 (windows and tire)\nDark Gray - 31 (tire and hitch)\nRed - 53 (camper stripe and detail on tire)\nDark Pink - 94 (door and outline of window)\nLight Pink - 22 (curtains)\nCamper Aqua - 153 (base of camper)\nBackground Gray -574 (background main)\nBackground Aqua - 77 (background highlight)\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32304\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pixel-Quilt-Squares-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"702\" />\n\nKeep workable stacks of your fabrics near your sewing machine so you can pull each color square as needed. Chain stitching will also make your piecing go much faster throughout the quilt.\n\n####Assembly instructions:\n<i>*Note: all seams are 1/4″ seam allowance</i>\n\nStart with the top left block square on the pattern. Sew together the first and second blocks, right sides together, in all five rows of the top left block.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32312\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-1-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"126\" height=\"307\" />\n\nCut the blocks apart. Sew the third blocks in the column to the second blocks in each row.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32313\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-2-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"171\" height=\"277\" />\n\nRepeat with columns four and five. You should now have 5 rows of 5 blocks.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32314\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-3-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"247\" />\n\nPress the seams to one side on the back but alternate which side you press to for each row. For example, press the top row to the left, the second row to the right, and so on. This will help the seams nest together.\n\nSew row one to row two – right sides together and meeting seams. Try to get the seams to line up, but also don't worry too much if they're the tiniest bit off. People will be so dazzled with your awesome camper quilt that they won't notice if a few of your seams are off. :)\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32315\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-4-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"239\" />\n\nContinue sewing the top row of blocks together, just the way you did with block one. You should have 8 blocks for the first row.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32316\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-5-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"573\" height=\"101\" />\n\nSew the blocks together to form Row 1 of the quilt. Only 5 more to go! You can press the seams open, or press them to the left. If you press them to the side, press the row two seams to the right, and alternate as you continue down the rows so the seams nest together.\n\nRefer to the pdf pattern and repeat these steps down each row of the quilt. Because there are so many little squares, I found it easier to assemble each row as I completed the blocks. This keeps each block in the correct row and you can make sure you have the alignment and direction correct.\n\nOnce you have all six rows finished, begin sewing the rows together. Sew row one to row two, lining up the block seams and pinning. Next, sew row 3 to row 2 and so on down the quilt. Press the long row seams open and give the quilt a final pressing.\n\nQuilt and bind as desired. Mine was quilted with an all over orange peel design by <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Julies-Longarm-Quilting-Service-794549267317106/\">Julie Williams</a>.\n\nAfter quilting I decided I wanted my camper to pop a little more so I stitched around the entire outline of the camper with a running stitch using Black DMC Pearl Cotton. I love that it helps the white to stand out a little more on the gray background print!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32309\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/running-stitch-embroidery-on-quilt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32311\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vintage-Adventure-Retro-Camper-Quilt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\nI can't wait to see your versions of the Camper quilt!

The process will go much quicker and be  more accurate than cutting them out by hand.</p>\n\n<p>All the pieces for the quilt are cut at 2 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" squares. Cut your fabric into 2 1/2\" strips, then cut those strips into 2 1/2\" squares.</p>\n\n<p>Cut the fabrics into the following number of squares:</p>\n\n<p>White Tiny Floral - 160 (top of camper) <br />\nWhite Solid - 37 (windows and tire) <br />\nDark Gray - 31 (tire and hitch) <br />\nRed - 53 (camper stripe and detail on tire) <br />\nDark Pink - 94 (door and outline of window) <br />\nLight Pink - 22 (curtains) <br />\nCamper Aqua - 153 (base of camper) <br />\nBackground Gray -574 (background main) <br />\nBackground Aqua - 77 (background highlight)</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32304\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pixel-Quilt-Squares-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"702\" /></p>\n\n<p>Keep workable stacks of your fabrics near your sewing machine so you can pull each color square as needed. Chain stitching will also make your piecing go much faster throughout the quilt.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"assemblyinstructions\">Assembly instructions:</h4>\n\n<p><i>*Note: all seams are 1/4″ seam allowance</i></p>\n\n<p>Start with the top left block square on the pattern. Sew together the first and second blocks, right sides together, in all five rows of the top left block.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32312\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-1-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"126\" height=\"307\" /></p>\n\n<p>Cut the blocks apart. Sew the third blocks in the column to the second blocks in each row.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32313\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-2-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"171\" height=\"277\" /></p>\n\n<p>Repeat with columns four and five. You should now have 5 rows of 5 blocks.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32314\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-3-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"247\" /></p>\n\n<p>Press the seams to one side on the back but alternate which side you press to for each row. For example, press the top row to the left, the second row to the right, and so on. This will help the seams nest together.</p>\n\n<p>Sew row one to row two – right sides together and meeting seams. Try to get the seams to line up, but also don't worry too much if they're the tiniest bit off. People will be so dazzled with your awesome camper quilt that they won't notice if a few of your seams are off. :)</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32315\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-4-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"236\" height=\"239\" /></p>\n\n<p>Continue sewing the top row of blocks together, just the way you did with block one. You should have 8 blocks for the first row.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32316\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Retro-Camper-Instructions-5-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"573\" height=\"101\" /></p>\n\n<p>Sew the blocks together to form Row 1 of the quilt. Only 5 more to go! You can press the seams open, or press them to the left. If you press them to the side, press the row two seams to the right, and alternate as you continue down the rows so the seams nest together.</p>\n\n<p>Refer to the pdf pattern and repeat these steps down each row of the quilt. Because there are so many little squares, I found it easier to assemble each row as I completed the blocks. This keeps each block in the correct row and you can make sure you have the alignment and direction correct.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have all six rows finished, begin sewing the rows together. Sew row one to row two, lining up the block seams and pinning. Next, sew row 3 to row 2 and so on down the quilt. Press the long row seams open and give the quilt a final pressing.</p>\n\n<p>Quilt and bind as desired. Mine was quilted with an all over orange peel design by <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Julies-Longarm-Quilting-Service-794549267317106/\">Julie Williams</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After quilting I decided I wanted my camper to pop a little more so I stitched around the entire outline of the camper with a running stitch using Black DMC Pearl Cotton. I love that it helps the white to stand out a little more on the gray background print!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32309\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/running-stitch-embroidery-on-quilt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1350\" /></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32311\" src=\"https://flamingotoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vintage-Adventure-Retro-Camper-Quilt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>I can't wait to see your versions of the Camper quilt!

Heather creates community wherever she goes. Crimson Tate : Modern Quilter was born out of an obsession with creating non-traditional quilts from contemporary, modern, and repurposed vintage fabrics. Engineered by Heather Givans, Purdue University graduate of Art History, Art Education, and Fine Arts (Printmaking), Crimson Tate quilts are good design coupled with an attention to detail and craftsmanship.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/CB-2881_blog_heatherGivens_projects-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHeather learned to quilt when helping her mother fulfill a 30-year dream of learning to sew. Together, the two of them set off to quilt camp in the heart of the Midwest, where Heather fell in love with fabric, texture, patterns, and an amazing sea of sewers who possessed an endless wealth of sewing knowledge. With a hot cup of coffee on hand – maybe a little too much cream – and some great folk tunes, Heather began working on new designs in her basement located near Lake Superior in Duluth, MN. There, she enjoyed inspiration from the beautiful scenes surrounding her.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/Headshot_Heather_Givans02-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nToday, Heather designs fabric for <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/heather-givans\" target=\"_blank\">Windham Fabrics</a>, works on new pattern designs,  giggles contagiously, and teaches sewing with her energetic friends and staff among the hustle and bustle of Downtown Indianapolis. You can find her hanging out at 845 Massachusetts Avenue, an open to the public studio.\n\n####Q&A\n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for art and design?\nAs a kid, I loved art more than anything. I created treasure maps, home videos, grew my own flower garden, and surrounded myself with art books from the public library. Henri Matisse was always my favorite. I wanted to learn how to do all kinds of creative works.\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\nWhimsy, tonal, fun!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/NIGHTHIKE_Final_9R1A8990-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\nI have two fabric collections out right now. Let me tell you about them both! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/night-hike\" target=\"_blank\">Night Hike</a> is an homage to my time at summer camp and also a little love note to my Grandma who lives in Northern Minnesota. The collection is inspired by the colors of the aurora borealis (the Northern lights) with deep purples and greens. I love how the light bounces off of the lake in a vibrant beautiful green hue. The collection contains lake maps, camp maps, tiny pine trees, fire flies, moths, and the night sky. All of these things are quintessential summer.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/NIGHTHIKE_Final_9R1A9367-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI also have a basics collection called <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/jot\" target=\"_blank\">JOT</a> and it’s filled with all kinds of blank paper in pale tones. College rule, elementary penmanship paper, scientific grid, ledger, library cards, and date stamps round out the collection. Did I mention that I’m a paper LOVER?! I love paper so much, almost as much as fabric. This basics collection folds in nicely with other collections as a background player.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/JOT_IMG_0256-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####You teamed up with Windham to create your line of textiles. What about Windham made them the perfect partner for you?\n\nWindham cares about art. Windham cares about artists. I am deeply appreciative that <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/heather-givans\" target=\"_blank\">Windham Fabrics</a> allows me create fabric collections. I am absolutely respected as an artist. They care about quality of goods and consistency of printing which is also important to me. I love those guys. They have made me feel like part of their family. I can’t imagine a better company to partner with than Windham. Did you see all of those hearts in my eyes as I talked about them?\n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric from your entire line, what would it be and why? \n\nWhat a tough question! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0572893/night-hike-way-finding-light-grey\" target=\"_blank\">Way Finding in Light Grey</a> is my absolute favorite right now. It takes me right to the summer lake, standing on the shore fishing with my dad or riding in a pontoon with my grandma. Those memories are so strong in my mind and this fabric transports me swiftly to that place. I love it so much.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/0572893.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in sewing?\nI love improv piecing and quilting. I always am inspired by social justice quilts, too, albeit they aren’t necessarily tending but rather a constant art statement.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/NIGHTHIKE_WishingStarQuilt-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nSo often I am blown away at what people will make. Of course, I have a set of ideas that I think are awesome that I conceive while designing the fabric, like Wishing Star quilt. I knew I wanted those purples and blues and greys to all hang out together. But when I see someone make something I never would have thought of, I’m dumbfounded. And to see a project that is constructed for a momentous occasion, too, using my fabrics I’m humbled and in awe. That’s a pretty awesome part of this job.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/NIGHTHIKE_R1A9723-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####What projects are on your “must make” list right now?\nI am in the midst of making a Personal Library quilt using <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/night-hike\" target=\"_blank\">Night Hike</a> which I’m super excited about. I am also in the middle of making a more green-centric Wishing Star quilt for a good friend. She doesn’t know about it so let’s not say anything more about it! ;)\n\nNext on the list is Latifah Saafir’s Clammy Half Circles quilt pattern made from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/jot\" target=\"_blank\">JOT</a>. Oh yeah! I’m excited about that one, too.\n\n####What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?\nThis list is vast and constantly being added to! Right now I am in awe and am inspired by words and works of these artists and authors: Chawne Kimber, Carolyn Friedlander, Christian Robinson, Jandy Nelson, Angie Thomas, Colson Whitehead and Yaa Gyasi.\n\n####What’s coming up for you in 2018? What’s next?\nI’m teaching workshops and lectures across the United States, which is pretty fun. Also, I’m always working on new patterns and fabric designs.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/NIGHTHIKE_FootnoteQuilt_Final_Night%20Hike_12-9_3800-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?\nI am OBSESSED with plants, mostly succulents and cactuses. Living in Indiana, I’ve outgrown my window space for the winter with all of the new plants I’ve started this summer. Eeeeeek! What am I going to do when cold weather arrives? Oh no.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Designer Spotlight Heather Givans](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Heather%20Givans/JOT_IMG_0262-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Tell us one thing people might not know about you.\nI taught high school art for nearly 10 years. I love teaching art from painting, drawing, ceramics, printmaking, photography, to graphic design. There are days I miss teaching dearly but I’m loving riding this wave of awesome.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/heather-givans\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop fabrics by Heather Givans for Windham Fabrics!</a>",

With all the fabrics (not to mention the colors and designs) available, how do you choose the one which is right for you? Here is some information on various fabric to help you select the right <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?&usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for your furniture.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyGN4f8TaFU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n####Durability\n\nIf you are planning to upholster something that will experience everyday wear and tear, durability is important to consider. Upholstery fabric’s durability is determined by how it rates on the manufacturer-administered double rub test, which is a back and forth motion that mimics the wear and tear of someone sitting on an upholstered seat over time. The higher the number of double rubs, (for example 100,000 vs 10,000) the better the indicator of quality and durability. In addition to higher double rubs, look for upholstery fabrics treated for performance, like stain resistance, water repellant, or UV resistance. \n\nFor upholstery projects that will not be used every day, like decorative or heirloom pieces, performance characteristics might not be as important, which opens up a wider variety including silk, wool, linen, cotton duck, embellished fabrics and more! Just look for home décor fabrics in the medium to very heavyweight range. \n\n####Fabric Care\nUpholstery fabric is often not suitable for traditional washing or dry cleaning once applied to furniture; therefore, you must follow the manufacturer’s instructions and look for stain repellent fabrics for heavier-use pieces. Our recommendation for dry-cleaning is intended prior to upholstering, if cleaning before use is desired. Once upholstered, use spot cleaners intended for upholstery fabric, or upholstery cleaning services. Using a fabric protectant spray over your finished furniture is highly recommended.\n\n####Fabric Types\nThese common, upholstery fabrics come in a variety of weights, colors, fibers, and treatments to ensure you get the fabric you need for your project. \n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=chenille&usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a> –  Excellent  fabric choice for home usage, primarily heavier use pieces. Similar to velvet, it has a cut pile that aids in abrasion resistance and comfort.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20Perfect%20Upholstery%20Fabric/chenille.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0486577/trend-03345-chenille-blossom\" target=\"_blank\">Trend 03345 Chenille Blossom Fabric</a> \n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=faux-suede&usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">Faux suede / Microfiber / Ultrasuede</a> – Typically a polyester multi-weave fabric with a surface abrasion treatment giving it a fuzzy, sueded pile to mimic suede, this fabric is an excellent choice for heavy-use family rooms and pets. It’s very strong, abrasion resistant and easy to clean.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Upholstery](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Picking%20Perfect%20Upholstery%20Fabric/faux%20suede.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0566290/swavelle-mill-creek-zadak-suede-oat\" target=\"_blank\">Swavelle/Mill Creek Zadak Suede Oat Fabric</a> \n\n* <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=velvet&usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">Velvet</a> – Velvet has a dense cut pile, making it luxuriously soft with a sheen. Velvet can stand up to heavy usage, and is an attractive choice for most homes.

With all the fabrics (not to mention the colors and designs) available, how do you choose the one which is right for you? Here is some information on various fabric to help you select the right <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?&amp;usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">fabric</a> for your furniture.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyGN4f8TaFU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h4 id=\"durability\">Durability</h4>\n\n<p>If you are planning to upholster something that will experience everyday wear and tear, durability is important to consider. Upholstery fabric’s durability is determined by how it rates on the manufacturer-administered double rub test, which is a back and forth motion that mimics the wear and tear of someone sitting on an upholstered seat over time. The higher the number of double rubs, (for example 100,000 vs 10,000) the better the indicator of quality and durability. In addition to higher double rubs, look for upholstery fabrics treated for performance, like stain resistance, water repellant, or UV resistance. </p>\n\n<p>For upholstery projects that will not be used every day, like decorative or heirloom pieces, performance characteristics might not be as important, which opens up a wider variety including silk, wool, linen, cotton duck, embellished fabrics and more! Just look for home décor fabrics in the medium to very heavyweight range. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"fabriccare\">Fabric Care</h4>\n\n<p>Upholstery fabric is often not suitable for traditional washing or dry cleaning once applied to furniture; therefore, you must follow the manufacturer’s instructions and look for stain repellent fabrics for heavier-use pieces. Our recommendation for dry-cleaning is intended prior to upholstering, if cleaning before use is desired. Once upholstered, use spot cleaners intended for upholstery fabric, or upholstery cleaning services. Using a fabric protectant spray over your finished furniture is highly recommended.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"fabrictypes\">Fabric Types</h4>\n\n<p>These common, upholstery fabrics come in a variety of weights, colors, fibers, and treatments to ensure you get the fabric you need for your project. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/home-decor-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=chenille&amp;usage=upholstery\" target=\"_blank\">Chenille</a> –  Excellent  fabric choice for home usage, primarily heavier use pieces.

I have always loved everything beautiful in life; like music, colours in the sky or fantastic interior.\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\nBright colours. 50 shades of white. Flowers.\n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\nThe Kaalimetsä (cabbage forest) fabric I designed for Marimekko’s Fall 2018 collection is inspired by our own home garden here in Helsinki. We have lots of kale there; it looks like a miniature forest.\n\n####How did you first partner with Marimekko? How has Marimekko helped bring your designs to life on fabric?\nIn 2003 I won a design competition co-organised by Marimekko and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The pattern that I designed for the competition, Hetkiä (moments), is still part of Marimekko’s fabric collection. We designers have a great freedom in designing new patterns with different kinds of hand drawn techniques. Marimekko’s design studio is located in the same building with the in-house printing factory where 1 million meters of fabric is printed every year – this allows us designers to work closely with the craftsmen printing our designs to fabric step by step.\n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric from all of your designs, what would it be and why?\nThat changes all the time as I tend to like the most my latest designs. The dearest Marimekko project for me was the designs I did for Marimekko’s Oiva (superb) tableware series that was launched in 2009. I first designed the prints that were inspired by small city gardens in Helsinki to match the shapes of ceramics. Later the same prints were scaled for fabrics and other products too.\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in home décor or DIY?\nFunctionality first in home décor too: anything to hide all the Legos we have currently on the floor at home.\n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nI love to see customers creating DIY projects with my fabric that are meaningful for them and that bring joy to the everyday life.

I have always loved everything beautiful in life; like music, colours in the sky or fantastic interior.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"describeyouraestheticin3words\">Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.</h4>\n\n<p>Bright colours. 50 shades of white. Flowers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatwastheinspirationbehindyourlatestfabricrelease\">What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?</h4>\n\n<p>The Kaalimetsä (cabbage forest) fabric I designed for Marimekko’s Fall 2018 collection is inspired by our own home garden here in Helsinki. We have lots of kale there; it looks like a miniature forest.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"howdidyoufirstpartnerwithmarimekkohowhasmarimekkohelpedbringyourdesignstolifeonfabric\">How did you first partner with Marimekko? How has Marimekko helped bring your designs to life on fabric?</h4>\n\n<p>In 2003 I won a design competition co-organised by Marimekko and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The pattern that I designed for the competition, Hetkiä (moments), is still part of Marimekko’s fabric collection. We designers have a great freedom in designing new patterns with different kinds of hand drawn techniques. Marimekko’s design studio is located in the same building with the in-house printing factory where 1 million meters of fabric is printed every year – this allows us designers to work closely with the craftsmen printing our designs to fabric step by step.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ifyouhadtochooseonefavoritefabricfromallofyourdesignswhatwoulditbeandwhy\">If you had to choose one favorite fabric from all of your designs, what would it be and why?</h4>\n\n<p>That changes all the time as I tend to like the most my latest designs. The dearest Marimekko project for me was the designs I did for Marimekko’s Oiva (superb) tableware series that was launched in 2009. I first designed the prints that were inspired by small city gardens in Helsinki to match the shapes of ceramics. Later the same prints were scaled for fabrics and other products too.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatareyourcurrentfavoritetrendsinhomedcorordiy\">What are your current favorite trends in home décor or DIY?</h4>\n\n<p>Functionality first in home décor too: anything to hide all the Legos we have currently on the floor at home.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatdoyoulovemostaboutcreatingadiyprojectwithyourfabricorseeingcustomerscreatingdiyprojectswithyourfabric\">What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?</h4>\n\n<p>I love to see customers creating DIY projects with my fabric that are meaningful for them and that bring joy to the everyday life. I would be honored to see for example a blanket created for a newborn baby with one of my fabrics.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatotherblogsbrandsdesignersinspireyoumost\">What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?</h4>\n\n<p>From home décor, I like Danish brand Hay and visit their store always when I have a chance.

To assemble the grid, cut one short side and one long side off of each page to make it easier to tape together. Cut out pattern pieces. \n* Fold the fabric in half to quickly cut out the pieces 2 at a time. Lay all the pieces out on the fabric for placement before cutting.\n* Pay attention to the “stretch” lines on the fabric and place those lines parallel to the direction the fabric stretches the most.\n* Use pattern weights to hold the patterns in place while cutting. Table knives from your kitchen work great in a pinch. \n* After cutting, transfer Ear placement markings onto 2 of the Hood Side Panels and transfer the Mane placement markings onto the Outer Hood Center Panels.\n\n#####From the white knit fabric cut:\n4 pieces using the Hood Side Panel pattern (2 Right Side Hoods, 2 Left Side Hoods)\n1 piece using the Hood Lining Center Panel pattern\n2 pieces using the Outer Hood Center Panel pattern (1 Right Side panel, 1 Left Side panel)\n4 pieces using the Ear pattern\n\n#####From the Gold Lame fabric cut:\n1 piece using the Horn pattern \n4 pieces using the Wrist Hoof pattern\n4 pieces using the Ankle Hoof pattern\n\n#####From the medium weight fusible interfacing cut:\n2 pieces using the Ear pattern\n4 pieces using the Wrist Hoof pattern\n4 pieces using the Ankle Hoof pattern\n\n#####From the Tulle cut:\n3 stacks (16 layers thick) of 3’’ x 5’’ strips from each color for the Mane (12 stacks total).\n4 stacks (16 layers thick) of 3’’ x 12’’ strips from each color  for the Skirt (16 stacks total).\n\n*Tip: Cutting the tulle into 16 layer stacks is easiest done by folding the tulle into 8 layers, cutting two 7 inch strips (14’’ for the Skirt stacks), and stacking them on top of each other. Then use a rotary cutter and mat to square off the edges and cut the strips.  tulle tends to get unruly quickly. Keep it stacked up nicely by clipping the layers together with binding clips on one end. Trim a corner off of each stack to create a curved end on each strip. Note: If the tulle is wrinkled iron it before cutting for best results. Keep your Iron setting low to start with so you don’t melt the tulle.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%201.jpg)\n</p>\n\n\n####Sewing Instructions\n*All seams are sewn with a 1/2‘’ seam allowance unless otherwise specified.\n\n####Make the Hood Lining\nWith right sides together pin a Right Hood Side Panel to the Hood Lining Center Panel. Sew the panels together. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%202.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith right sides together, pin a Left Hood Side Panel to the other side of the Hood Lining Center Panel. Sew them together. Press the seams open as much as possible with a warm iron. Set this Hood Lining aside.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%203.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Ears\nFuse the Medium weight interfacing to the wrong side of two Ear pieces. With right sides together sew a interfaced Ear piece to a plain Ear piece along the curved edges of the triangle with a 1/4’’ seam. Clip and notch the curves and point. Turn right side out and press. Repeat for the 2nd Ear. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%204.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold each ear in half at the base and tuck the fold in to make a little pleat so that the Ear stands open a little easier. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%205.jpg)\n</p>\n\nBaste the Ears onto the right side of a Right and a Left  Hood Side Panel between the Ear placement marks. Make sure the Ears are facing forward. Set aside. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%206.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Mane\nSet the machine to sew a gathering stitch (5-6mm stitch length). Sew a row of gathering stitches about 3/8’’ away from the short, straight end of a stack of 3’’ x 5’’ strips.  Alternating colors, place the next stack right next to the other and continue to sew along the top connecting the stacks together. Alternate stacks in a rainbow pattern and make sure the curved ends are going the same direction. Sew a 2nd row of gathering stitches 5/8’’ from the edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%207.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPull the top 2 threads evenly from each side and gather the Mane so that each 3’’ strip shrinks down to 1’’.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%208.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSet the machine back to a regular stitch length (3 mm). With the right side of the fabric facing the Mane, pin the Mane to the straight side of an Outer Hood Center Panel between the Mane placement markings. Make sure the curved ends point toward the Neckline. Sew between the 2 rows of gathering stitches with a 1/2’’seam.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%209.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin the 2nd Outer Hood Panel to the the mane with right sides together and stitch in place along the same 1/2’’seam line. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2010.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Finish the Hood\nSew the Outer Hood together in the same fashion as the Hood Lining. (See steps 1-2). Check every few inches to make sure the layers of the knit lay flat as you sew. It is easy to for them to bunch up underneath if you are not careful. Press all seams open as best as you can.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2011.jpg)\n</p>\n\nSew a row of stay stitches in the seam allowance at the base of each Ear with the seam allowance folded toward the Hood Side Panel. This will help the ears to stand up. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2012.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWith right sides together, match the seams of the Hood Lining and the Outer Hood and pin them together around the face opening and all along the neckline. Making sure the Mane doesn’t get caught in the seam, sew around all the edges leaving a 4’’ opening in the bottom of the neckline for turning. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2013.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTrim the corners and clip into the seam allowance of the curves.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2014.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the Hood right side out through the opening and press around the edges so the Hood Lining sits nicely inside the Outer Hood. Pin the opening closed. Sew all the way around the Hood about 1/8’’ away from the edge. Attach the Hook and Loop tape to the front flaps by stitching around it close to the edge. It is helpful to sew around the tape twice if the Hood is going to be used a lot for dress up. Also, remove any gathering stitches that are showing on the Mane. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2015.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Horn\nSew a row of stitches 1/2’’ away from the curved base of the Horn. This marks the line where the Horn will meet the Hood. Sew a row of gathering stitches about 1/4’’ away from the same edge.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2016.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFold the horn in half with right sides together and stitch along the side with a ½’’ seam allowance. Clip the corner at the point.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2017.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the Horn right side out and stuff it.  Use small bits at first to help fill up the point. Stuff it just enough for the Horn to be firm but not distorted. Pull a gathering thread to cinch the end a little until the fabric folds along the 1/2’’ stitch line.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2018.jpg)\n</p>\n\nPin the Horn just in front of the Mane, overlapping the Mane about 1/4’’  Hand stitch the Horn through both layers of the hood coming up with the needle just to the outside of the stitching line on the Horn so it disappears as you sew.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2019.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Skirt\nCut a piece of 1’’ elastic to the length of your child’s waist. Using the longer stacked strips of Tulle fold the straight end over the elastic about 1 1/2’’. Stitch along the edge creating a casing for the elastic. Do not sew on the elastic. Continue to add the strip stacks in a rainbow pattern. Pin the end of the elastic to the first tulle strip so it doesn’t slide out. While keeping the needle down on the machine slide the elastic through the casing to gather the strips of tulle making room for the rest of the strips to be sewn onto the elastic.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2020.jpg)\n</p>\n\nWhen all the strips are sewn together, pull out the ends of the elastic and overlap them about 1/2’’. Stitch the elastic together in a few places using a zig zag stitch. Backstitch a few times to secure. Smooth the gathers out evenly and your skirt is done.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2021.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Make the Hooves\nFuse a piece of stabilizer to the wrong side of each Hoof piece. With right sides together sew around the Hoof using a 1/4’’ seam allowance. Leave an opening for turning along a straight side. Clip the corners and the curves. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2022.jpg)\n</p>\n\nTurn the Hoof right side out and stitch a strip of hook and loop tape to each straight side. Repeat for each of the Hooves. You should have 2 small ones for the wrists and 2 larger ones for the ankles.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2023.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI think the Hooves make a fun little detail to finish off the costume don’t you?\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/PHOTO%2024.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Unicorn](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Rainbow%20Unicorn%20Costume/Unicorn1.jpg)\n</p>\n\nHappy costume making!!\n\n\n",

Sara of <a href=\"https://thesaraproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sara Project</a> here, and back with another fun post for you! \n\nLet’s start off with a question: what is fall without <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a>? I’ve been seeing a lot of great <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> garments popping up in the ready to wear world lately. I fell in love with a pair of gold cord overalls I came across at Madewell recently, and headed over to fabric.com to find a similar fabric to copy the look. Oh my goodness, what a gorgeous selection of <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> options they have! I quickly found the color <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0305045/kaufman-14-wale-corduroy-cider\" target=\"_blank\">Cider</a> and knew that this project had to happen. Also, how yummy does the color <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0305045/kaufman-14-wale-corduroy-cider\" target=\"_blank\">Cider</a> sound? I think I would wear anything with the name Cider. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Corduroy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Corduroy%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20and%20Overalls/DSC_0084_2.jpg)\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Corduroy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Corduroy%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20and%20Overalls/DSC_0011.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI looked through a few different overall pattern options for this project, and decided to go with the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">Closet Case Patterns</a> Jenny Overalls. I love the high waist, and construction details of this pattern. Even better, fabric.com is now carrying some indie sewing patterns, including this one. So exciting!\n\nI’m here today to share my Jenny Overalls plus 8 tips for sewing with corduroy fabrics!\n\n####8 Tips for Sewing with Corduroy\nThese 8 tips will help you know how to choose your fabric, how to treat <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> fabric and the best ways to use it while sewing. Let’s begin!\n \n1) When purchasing <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> fabric online, pay attention to the wale count. This will inform you of how many wale stripes can be counted in one square inch and will help you determine if the fabric you are considering has a wider wale stripe or a more narrow wale stripe. This is important to pay attention to when planning out your project, depending on what look you are going for. A wider wale cord is very in style for fall this year, and gives the garment a more vintage vibe. I’m loving this trend!\n\n2) Make sure to pre-wash your fabric. Also make sure to pay attention to the contents of your fabric. This particular fabric I used from is 100% cotton, so it can be washed on a gentle cycle and tumbled dry on low heat.\n\n3) Pay attention to the nap and direction of the wales. Either way is totally acceptable, it really just depends on what look you personally desire for your project. For my <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Overalls</a>, the nap runs down along the grainline line. If I brush down with my hands the fabric feels smooth. If you brush your hands against the nap, the fabric will feel slightly rough. \n\n4) Remember to keep the ribs straight when you are cutting out your pattern pieces. If you have a wider wale, you can cut one piece out at a time to ensure the ribs are straight. For my overalls, I cut multiple pieces out at a time and it worked great.  \n\n5) Don’t use an iron! This will likely leave a mark on <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> fabrics. Instead you can lightly steam or finger press your seams open. Try testing these methods on a piece of scrap fabric first. I used the finger press method (no iron at all!) for this entire project and it worked really well. \n\n6) Don’t use fusible interfacing. Since we don’t want to use an iron, fusible interfacing is not a good option for a corduroy project. Instead use a non-fusible interfacing and attach it to the fabric on the wrong side, and baste the interfacing around the entire edge of the pattern piece within the given seam allowance.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Corduroy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Corduroy%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20and%20Overalls/photo1.JPG)\n</p>\n\n7) Since <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> is a thicker material to work with, it’s important to pay attention to the bulkiness of your seams. You can eliminate some of the bulk by grading your seams. This is definitely a step you want to incorporate when working with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> fabrics! \n\n8) Make sure to finish any raw edges, as <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a> does easily fray and unravel along unfinished edges. Using a serger to finish your edges is a great option, as well as a simple zig-zag finish or binding. I used my serger for my project and it worked great. \n\nThere you have it. Those are my top tips for sewing with <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/apparel-fashion-fabric.aspx?fabric-type=corduroy\" target=\"_blank\">corduroy</a>, and now we’re ready to jump into a project. Let’s talk about my <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Overalls</a>!\n \n####Jenny Overalls Project \n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">This pattern</a> is so fun to sew! Don’t be intimidated by all of the overall hardware! I didn’t find this pattern too challenging at all, and as always, I really enjoyed all of the topstitching. My measurements put me at a size 4 for this pattern, and found I needed to size down in the waist and crotch another size or so. It’s always better for the pattern to be a little too big than too small, so it worked out well. I took in the side seams and crotch seam a little and now I have a perfect fit. \n\nI also tapered the legs to have a straight leg fit closer to the Madewell overalls I fell in love with. I felt like a straight leg fit would be a little more practical for winter and snow. To taper the legs, baste the legs together as instructed in the pattern, try on the pants and pin the fabric in around your legs (in the center of the pant leg) to fit how you desire, and then baste. Try them on again and keep tweaking until the fit is just right. Remember that 100% cotton has no stretch, so be careful not to make the legs too fitted, or they will be unwearable. (Trust me, I’ve made this mistake before!). Here’s the original pattern pant leg compared to mine once I had the right fit: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Corduroy](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Corduroy%20Tips%20for%20Sewing%20and%20Overalls/photo2.JPG)\n</p>\n\nThe instructions are easy to follow, and the finished product is just so cool!

People will pick up the exact same materials and imagine completely different ways of using it. It’s amazing how much something can be made into so many diverse garments!\n\nWhen fabric.com challenged me to using one fabric in three different ways, I leapt at the chance to put my imagination to the test and come up with three gorgeous items!\n\nThe fabric I chose was from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/telio-cupro-tencel-linen\" target=\"_blank\">Telio's Tencel Linen Collection</a> – a right on trend gorgeous brick red cupro/tencel/linen mix which has a gorgeous sheen to it. I’m a big fan of using more eco-friendly fibers like tencel and cupro where I can! Besides being made in environmentally conscious ways, these fibers retain all the goodness of cotton like being moisture wicking, breathable, and soft. This fabric has a bit of weight to it and a lovely drape which made it perfect for the three projects I had in mind!\n\nThe first of which is the perfect fall skirt!\n\nI used the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0607326/mccalls-m7813-misses-skirts-and-belt-e5-sizes-14-22\" target=\"_blank\">McCall’s 7813 skirt pattern</a> to create a midi length wrap skirt. I chose to make View A which shows of a high waist, A-line shape and a fabric belt. This was a beautifully easy garment to sew up. I opted to use a proper button instead of the sew in metal snap the pattern recommends just so I felt a little more secure in it but it’s covered by the belt either way!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00004.jpeg)\n</p>\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00003.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nThe fabric flows beautifully as I walk in this skirt!\n\nThis skirt, heels and a chunky knit sweater combo is definitely going to be a wardrobe staple this winter.\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00009.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nMy second make with this fabric uses a pattern that I’ve been planning on making for a very long time. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0616519/closet-case-kalle-shirt-shirtdress\" target=\"_blank\">Kalle shirt/ shirtdress from Closet Case Patterns</a>! \n\nOK, so this make might be a little out of season for the UK right now since it’s getting a little chilly right now but I just couldn’t help it! When you know a pattern and fabric are the right match, sometimes you just have to go for it.\n\nI made the dress version of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0616519/closet-case-kalle-shirt-shirtdress\" target=\"_blank\">Kalle</a> with the popover placket. I chose to do the popover over the regular button band for no reason other than to try something new! I love challenging myself and with instructions from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">Closet Case Patterns</a>, I knew it would be a great opportunity to try a new technique.\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00006.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nThis one will be perfect with sandals or trainers in the summer though I might need to start layering it up because I don’t think I can wait that long to wear it!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00007.jpeg)\n</p>\n\n\nMy third (and favourite make) is the jumpsuit I made using the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0388596/butterick-b5652-misses-top-dress-caftan-jumpsuit-and-pants-pattern-size-0y0\" target=\"_blank\">Butterick 5652 pattern</a>. I had a feeling before I started sewing these garments that this would be my favorite and I was right – I always love a jumpsuit!\n\nThe pattern comes with several different views – a tunic, dress, jumpsuit and pants – all simple and very loose fitted. It’s one of those patterns where you know in the right fabric and styled well would look amazing!\n\nI think mine turned out pretty well!\n\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00005.jpeg)\n</p>\n\nI adjusted the pattern slightly on mine to lower the neckline a little. I also finished it with a facing instead of a bias binding. I shortened the torso by an inch and lengthened the leg by 2 inches. Lots of little adjustments to make it just right!\n\nIt does need to be belted though but luckily I’d already made a fabric one from my skirt project!\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/jumpsuit2.jpg)\n</p>\n\nI love how such a simple pattern can be transformed into quite a glamorous looking outfit with the right fabric!\n\nSo these are my three garments! They’re the perfect rust toned additions to my wardrobe that can be worn year round. I’m so pleased with how they’ve turned out.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/telio-cupro-tencel-linen\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop all Telio Cupro Tencel Linen</a>!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![1 Fabric 3 Ways](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00008.jpeg)\n</p>",

I opted to use a proper button instead of the sew in metal snap the pattern recommends just so I felt a little more secure in it but it’s covered by the belt either way!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00004.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00003.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The fabric flows beautifully as I walk in this skirt!</p>\n\n<p>This skirt, heels and a chunky knit sweater combo is definitely going to be a wardrobe staple this winter.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00009.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>My second make with this fabric uses a pattern that I’ve been planning on making for a very long time. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0616519/closet-case-kalle-shirt-shirtdress\" target=\"_blank\">Kalle shirt/ shirtdress from Closet Case Patterns</a>! </p>\n\n<p>OK, so this make might be a little out of season for the UK right now since it’s getting a little chilly right now but I just couldn’t help it! When you know a pattern and fabric are the right match, sometimes you just have to go for it.</p>\n\n<p>I made the dress version of the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0616519/closet-case-kalle-shirt-shirtdress\" target=\"_blank\">Kalle</a> with the popover placket. I chose to do the popover over the regular button band for no reason other than to try something new! I love challenging myself and with instructions from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/brands-and-designers/closet-case-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">Closet Case Patterns</a>, I knew it would be a great opportunity to try a new technique.</p>\n\n<p><p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00006.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p></p>\n\n<p>This one will be perfect with sandals or trainers in the summer though I might need to start layering it up because I don’t think I can wait that long to wear it!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00007.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>My third (and favourite make) is the jumpsuit I made using the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0388596/butterick-b5652-misses-top-dress-caftan-jumpsuit-and-pants-pattern-size-0y0\" target=\"_blank\">Butterick 5652 pattern</a>. I had a feeling before I started sewing these garments that this would be my favorite and I was right – I always love a jumpsuit!</p>\n\n<p>The pattern comes with several different views – a tunic, dress, jumpsuit and pants – all simple and very loose fitted. It’s one of those patterns where you know in the right fabric and styled well would look amazing!</p>\n\n<p>I think mine turned out pretty well!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00005.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>I adjusted the pattern slightly on mine to lower the neckline a little. I also finished it with a facing instead of a bias binding. I shortened the torso by an inch and lengthened the leg by 2 inches. Lots of little adjustments to make it just right!</p>\n\n<p>It does need to be belted though but luckily I’d already made a fabric one from my skirt project!</p>\n\n<p><p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/jumpsuit2.jpg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p></p>\n\n<p>I love how such a simple pattern can be transformed into quite a glamorous looking outfit with the right fabric!</p>\n\n<p>So these are my three garments! They’re the perfect rust toned additions to my wardrobe that can be worn year round. I’m so pleased with how they’ve turned out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/telio-cupro-tencel-linen\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop all Telio Cupro Tencel Linen</a>!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/1%20Fabric%203%20Ways/image00008.jpeg\" alt=\"1 Fabric 3 Ways\" />\n</p>",

Rae confesses that she’s greatly inspired by the lushness of nature, classic children's books and old photographs.\n  \n####Q&A\n\n####When did you realize you had a passion for art and design? \nBeing the daughter of a photographer/art teacher and a musician, I’ve experimented with many art forms from an early age. As a younger child, mom always kept us busy with various projects, from Sculpey clay jewelry and tie-dye to drawing and oil painting. As a young teenager I was obsessed with writing and performing songs, playing guitar, painting and sewing my own clothes. I feel like there was no other option from me than to pursue a career in a creative field!\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\nMagical, antique, lush\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Rae Ritchie](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Rae%20Ritchie/Gingko2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\nMy favorite of the releases is <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=rae-ritchie&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">“Natural History”</a> which has an interesting inspiration story! In January of this year, I was fortunate enough to travel to Frankfurt, Germany for work! Since I was going over to Europe anyway, I decided to make a 3 day stop in London and museum, HARD! My favorite museum was of course, the Natural History Museum. Everything about it; the building, the specimens, the feeling; I just fell in love. I took many reference photos of the animals, and many were used as inspiration for this very collection. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Rae Ritchie](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Rae%20Ritchie/NatHist1-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####You teamed up with Dear Stella to create your line of textiles. What about Dear Stella made them the perfect partner for you?\nI really enjoy working with Dear Stella. They really took a chance on me, and I couldn’t be more grateful. What I really love is the freedom they’ve given me to explore my ideas and also their high level of enthusiasm for the quilting industry! \n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric from your entire line, what would it be and why? \nThe fungi print from <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=rae-ritchie&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">“Natural History”</a> It reminds me of an old botanical print, invoking moods of victorian apothecaries and William Morris wallpaper. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Rae Ritchie](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Rae%20Ritchie/NatHist2-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in sewing?\nShirt dresses with pockets! I don’t do a lot of sewing anymore, but love some of the styles collettepatterns.com offers! Modern with a vintage flair is always up my ally.\n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nIt’s just amazing what the sewing community can come up with! I’ve seen amazing sturdy handbags, overalls, pajamas, pencil cases, and even a pin cushion, all made with my fabric! Several that have really caught my eye are those using embroidery to artfully add their own illustrative elements to my prints! It’s an amazing way to collaborate. \n\n####What projects are on your “must make” list right now?\nI would really like to make a flowy sack dress! I have one that I purchased when American Apparel was closing their stores. Myself and two of my friends all bought the \"one size” frock, endearingly referring to it as “The Dress.” It works for all occasions and I would love to make more! \n\nI also always have a good knitting project in the works! Right now I’m making some warm thigh high heather gray wool socks (I do live in Minnesota after all!). Next, I’d like to make a cocoon sweater.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Rae Ritchie](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Rae%20Ritchie/IMG_6681-min.JPG)\n</p>\n\n####What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?\nI love spooky beauty brands! Packaging in general is always very inspirational to me, but my favorite beauty brand is Black Phoenix Apothocary. They make an amazing Alice and Wonderland perfume oil line, as well as a huge Neil Gaiman perfume collaboration, which makes me VERY happy! I also follow a lot of amazing tattoo artists in the etching type of style, like Rachel Hauer and the Lacemakers’ Sweatshop @thelacemakerssweatshop. \n\n####What’s coming up for you in 2019? What’s next?\nI’d really like to continue doing what I’m doing, but hopefully add in more editorial/book work. I’ve illustrated for other authors books, but not yet a story of my own. We’ll see!\n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?\nOne of my favorite pastimes is physical activity! I ran my first (and probably last) marathon in 2017 (Twin Cities Marathon). It was by far the most difficult thing I’ve ever done! I’m also an avid cycler, and my favorite new activity in that realm is bike packing/camping. It makes for some great adventures! I’ve also been having fun doing a little climbing at an indoor bouldering gym here in Minneapolis!\n\nI’m also getting back into knitting recently, which was an activity that dominated my life about 5 years ago. I used to be a cold weather head and hand designer, and also knitted and crocheted sweaters and other items on the side! Now I usually just hand knit socks because they’re small and useful!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Rae Ritchie](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Rae%20Ritchie/NatHist5-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####Tell us one thing people might not know about you.\nMy favorite food is seaweed!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?brands-and-designers=rae-ritchie&sort=Newest+Arrivals+(Descending)\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop all Rae Ritchie for Dear Stella fabric!</a>\n\n",

Every year, I say I’m going to make something festive for my house and every year I am too busy to do it. This year I decided was going to be different! I knew I had to make something small, something that could be accomplished in small increments, or all in one evening. \n\nHere are five fast, simple and cute mini blocks for you to make this season. You can even turn these into mug rugs, table runners, mini quilts, pillows, placemats, and more!\n\nLet's get started!\n<i>*Note: All seams are a scant 1/4”, unless otherwise stated.\nSpray starch is strongly recommended, but not required.</i>\n\n####Fabrics Used\nTo create these mini blocks, we combined two of our favorite festive pre-cut bundles:The <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/buy/0603533/riley-blake-designs-crayola-solids-fat-eighth-box-10-pcs-christmas\" target=\"_blank\">Riley Blake Crayola Fat Eighth Christmas bundle</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/collection/kaufman-artisan-batiks-snowflakes\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kaufman Artisan Batiks Snowflakes Fat Quarter bundle</a>.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Holiday Mini Blocks](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Mini%20Quilt%20Blocks/0603533.jpg)\n</p> \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Holiday Mini Blocks](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Mini%20Quilt%20Blocks/Photo%20Nov%2015%2C%205%2056%2032%20PM-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nYou can use any quilting fabric to create these blocks! <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/quilting-fabric.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to shop all quilting fabric</a> and select your favorites.\n\n\n####Wreath Mini Block\n<p align=\"center\">\n![Holiday Mini Blocks](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Holiday%20Mini%20Quilt%20Blocks/IMG_0557-min.jpg)\n</p>\n\nFrom Background Fabric, cut:\n1- 3.5” square\n4- 1.5” squares\n\nFrom Green Fabric, cut:\n4- 1.5” squares\n2- 1.5”x5.5”\n1- 1.5”x3.5”\n2- 1.5” squares\n\nFrom Red Fabric, cut:\n1- 1.5” square\n\nPlace the 3.5” background square right side up.

Her creativity, content expertise, media presence, and recent graduation from Harvard Business School under the OPM Program for entrepreneurship have contributed to her growing international lifestyle business. Jennifer’s home improvement and design guidebook, Love Coming Home, is due out August 2018.\n\n####Q&A\n<br>\n####When did you realize you had a passion for art and design? \n\nI came from humble beginnings. Raising a family of four children, my parents had to work hard and be incredibly resourceful. Everything in our home, from our furniture and our clothes, were either handmade by my mom or given to us. She even made our sofa. So from an early age, I learned how to be creative and inventive. I was always rearranging the furniture and the décor in my tiny bedroom, one time tacking beach towels to the walls of my room to create a tropical cabana look. I remember one of my wildest, room-refresh ideas was dyeing my yellow and green shag carpet by adding blue dye to a carpet steam cleaner my mom rented from the local market. Luckily for me it wasn’t a total disaster, and the carpet did in fact eventually turn into a lovely shade of blue. I was so proud of my carpet masterpiece!\n\n####Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.\n\nEffortless, modern, clean\n\n####What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?\n\nI’m all about a Southern California, Easy Breazy Boho vibe. Barefoot and effortless is the best! I made sure to reflect this in my latest fabric release. \n\n####You teamed up with Covington to create your line of textiles. What about Covington made them the perfect partner for you?\n\nI love the people at Covington. It’s important to me to find partners who believe in collaboration and creating high-quality products, and the talented staff at Covington do just that.  And I especially love that their price points make our fabrics accessible to most.\n\n####If you had to choose one favorite fabric from your entire line, what would it be and why? \nWeathersfield and Mazinda. I like their boho-chic style.\n\n####What are your current favorite trends in sewing/DIY?\nI love DIY big, bold accent pillows. The bigger the better, and with clean knife edges. It’s fun to mix and match decorative pillows in various shapes and sizes, in all areas of your home, they express so much of your unique personality.\n\n####What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?\nDIY projects allow great design to be accessible to everybody. It’s always inspiring to see others take a creative idea and bring it to fruition. It feels good to know that I’ve played a small part in that. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n![DS Jennifer Adams](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Jennifer%20Adams/Jennifer%20Adams%20Window_Curio.jpg)\n</p>\n\n####What projects are on your “must make” list right now?\nIt’s hard to pick a favorite! I love DIY headboards, dining chairs and using fabric on the wall as art.  I’m making my own decorative pillows right now. And, I’m fascinated with finding objects that I can turn into art pieces (especially from my fabric line!).\n\n####What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?\nDesigners that inspire me include Emily Henderson, I love her décor style and sense of whimsy, and Tammy Price for her clean, California look that uses neutrals layered with textures. I also adore Rebecca Atwood for her unique and beautiful textiles and patterns. These three designers are brilliant, each one a creative force that brings something special to home design. Another big inspiration is Deepak Chopra. For me, home and life are intertwined, and Chopra’s writings and advocacy for healthier, holistic living in your home and environment align with my own love coming home philosophy. I believe home is where your best live begins.\n\n####What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?\nYoga, meditation, and writing. I also love to sit in my backyard, relaxing with my dogs and a glass of wine, dreaming up new and improved ways to do something creative. Creativity ignites my soul and gives me great joy.\n\n####Tell us one thing people might not know about you.\nI’m an introverted extrovert. As much as I like to be on TV or do public speaking engagements, I’m actually most comfortable having time one-on-one. I’m also addicted to creating Vision Boards… for pretty much everything!  ",

I was so proud of my carpet masterpiece!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"describeyouraestheticin3words\">Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.</h4>\n\n<p>Effortless, modern, clean</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatwastheinspirationbehindyourlatestfabricrelease\">What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?</h4>\n\n<p>I’m all about a Southern California, Easy Breazy Boho vibe. Barefoot and effortless is the best! I made sure to reflect this in my latest fabric release. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"youteamedupwithcovingtontocreateyourlineoftextileswhataboutcovingtonmadethemtheperfectpartnerforyou\">You teamed up with Covington to create your line of textiles. What about Covington made them the perfect partner for you?</h4>\n\n<p>I love the people at Covington. It’s important to me to find partners who believe in collaboration and creating high-quality products, and the talented staff at Covington do just that.  And I especially love that their price points make our fabrics accessible to most.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ifyouhadtochooseonefavoritefabricfromyourentirelinewhatwoulditbeandwhy\">If you had to choose one favorite fabric from your entire line, what would it be and why?</h4>\n\n<p>Weathersfield and Mazinda. I like their boho-chic style.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatareyourcurrentfavoritetrendsinsewingdiy\">What are your current favorite trends in sewing/DIY?</h4>\n\n<p>I love DIY big, bold accent pillows. The bigger the better, and with clean knife edges. It’s fun to mix and match decorative pillows in various shapes and sizes, in all areas of your home, they express so much of your unique personality.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatdoyoulovemostaboutcreatingadiyprojectwithyourfabricorseeingcustomerscreatingdiyprojectswithyourfabric\">What do you love most about creating a DIY project with your fabric (or seeing customers creating DIY projects with your fabric)?</h4>\n\n<p>DIY projects allow great design to be accessible to everybody. It’s always inspiring to see others take a creative idea and bring it to fruition. It feels good to know that I’ve played a small part in that. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">  \n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Designer%20Spotlight%20Jennifer%20Adams/Jennifer%20Adams%20Window_Curio.jpg\" alt=\"DS Jennifer Adams\" />\n</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatprojectsareonyourmustmakelistrightnow\">What projects are on your “must make” list right now?</h4>\n\n<p>It’s hard to pick a favorite! I love DIY headboards, dining chairs and using fabric on the wall as art.  I’m making my own decorative pillows right now. And, I’m fascinated with finding objects that I can turn into art pieces (especially from my fabric line!).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatotherblogsbrandsdesignersinspireyoumost\">What other blogs/brands/designers inspire you most?</h4>\n\n<p>Designers that inspire me include Emily Henderson, I love her décor style and sense of whimsy, and Tammy Price for her clean, California look that uses neutrals layered with textures. I also adore Rebecca Atwood for her unique and beautiful textiles and patterns. These three designers are brilliant, each one a creative force that brings something special to home design. Another big inspiration is Deepak Chopra. For me, home and life are intertwined, and Chopra’s writings and advocacy for healthier, holistic living in your home and environment align with my own love coming home philosophy. I believe home is where your best live begins.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatdoyoulovetodowhenyouarentdesigningandcreating\">What do you love to do when you aren’t designing and creating?</h4>\n\n<p>Yoga, meditation, and writing. I also love to sit in my backyard, relaxing with my dogs and a glass of wine, dreaming up new and improved ways to do something creative. Creativity ignites my soul and gives me great joy.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tellusonethingpeoplemightnotknowaboutyou\">Tell us one thing people might not know about you.</h4>\n\n<p>I’m an introverted extrovert. As much as I like to be on TV or do public speaking engagements, I’m actually most comfortable having time one-on-one. I’m also addicted to creating Vision Boards… for pretty much everything!  </p>",

The collection is inspired by their love of flowers, vintage, and the 1970s. The designs feature whimsical warm tones in classic patterns anyone can love including florals, stripes, and polka dots. Flower Market is the perfect collection to add some vintage flare to your next sewing project.\n<hr>\n<h3>Q&A</h3>\n<h4>When did you realize you had a passion for art and design?</h4>\nOur mom went to school to teach art, but then she had me right as she graduated college. She did eventually teach art in a classroom, but while we were little she did projects with us all the time. Art was a huge part of our childhood. She taught me to make my own fabrics in high school with wax sticks and dye. So I feel like our whole lives we've been very into art- thank you mom!\n<h4>Describe your aesthetic in 3 words.</h4>\nVintage-inspired, cozy, warm.\n<h4>What was the inspiration behind your latest fabric release?</h4>\nOur collection was inspired by our love for vintage floral prints. We both collect and wear vintage. One of our first businesses was a vintage shop when we were younger. So we've always been inspired by the sixties and seventies and it really came out through this collection.\n![Beautiful Mess collage 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/DS%20A%20Beautiful%20Mess/CB-3681_Blog_DF_ABeuaM_Collage1.jpg)\n<h4>You teamed up with PBS Fabrics to create your line of textiles.

I am a big fan of bright colors, funky patterns, and anything floral. I love making accessories and clothing that are as unique as my clients. Whether it is a hair scarf or custom dress I believe that the right clothing can elevate your everyday look and make you feel special.</p>\n![Picture of Whitney](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/headshot2.jpg)\n<h3>Q&A</h3>\n<h4>When did you realize you wanted to start a business?</h4>\n<p>I realized I wanted to start a business when my closet couldn’t hold any more clothes because I was sewing so much! I knew I wanted to keep designing and creating so I thought about sewing for clients. My co-workers kept asking where I purchased my clothes and were always impressed when I told them I had made them. That was when I knew it was time to start selling my own designs.</p>\n<h4>What was the inspiration behind your products?</h4>\n<p>I was inspired to make custom clothing while teaching second grade at an orthodox Jewish school in Los Angeles. The school’s dress code made it hard to wear clothing from most stores so I went to the fashion district, bought some fabric, and made my own skirts and dresses. I was inspired to start making hair accessories because I wanted to make unique, handmade fashion items at a more accessible price point.</p>\n![Picture of Juniper Dress Co. hair scarfs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/product4.jpg)\n<h4>If you had to choose one favorite product from your entire line, what would it be and why?</h4>\n<p>My favorite product is the Black and White Polka Dot Hair Scarf. I love this scarf because the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=pebble+crepe\">pebble crepe</a> is such a beautiful fabric and the scarf is extremely versatile. Not only does the color go with everything but there are so many different ways to wear it. I like to tie mine around my ponytail and wear it as a headband.</p>\n![Picture of Pebble Crepe SKUs](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/pebblecrepe_skus.jpg)\n<p><i>Featured fabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=pebble+crepe\">TELIO Pebble Crepe</a></i></p>\n<h4>Why do you love working with Fabric.com? </h4>\n<p>There are three main reasons I love working with Fabric.com:\n<ul><li>Their selection is incredible! There are so many options when it comes to fibers, colors, and patterns.</li><li> I also love how reasonable the prices are. You can find beautiful high quality fabrics for a fraction of the cost of major retailers. </li><li>The last reason is that they offer free shipping on orders over a certain amount. As a small business owner who orders fabric regularly that is such a nice perk!</li></ul></p>\n<h4>What is the most unexpected way you’ve worked with fabric?</h4>\n<p>I recently had my first baby and I used some spandex fabric to make a pumping bra!</p>\n<h4>What piece of advice do you wish you had before starting your business?</h4><p>In the past few months I have started listening to Jenna Kutcher’s Goal Digger Podcast. She talks a lot about having a mindset of abundance. That basically means believing that there is enough success, growth, and happiness for everyone. Just because someone else is successful doesn’t mean there is any less success for you.</p>\n![Picture of Hair Accessories 1](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/Product1.jpg)\n<h4>How do you market your business? What has been the most impactful marketing tool you’ve used and why?</h4><p>I love to use social media to market my business. I also love to do local craft fairs and handmade markets because I get to meet my customers in person. I think that connecting with people face to face is the best way to market your business! </p>\n![Picture of Hair Accessories 2](https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/product3.jpg)\n",

The school’s dress code made it hard to wear clothing from most stores so I went to the fashion district, bought some fabric, and made my own skirts and dresses. I was inspired to start making hair accessories because I wanted to make unique, handmade fashion items at a more accessible price point.</p>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/product4.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Juniper Dress Co. hair scarfs\" /></p>\n\n<h4>If you had to choose one favorite product from your entire line, what would it be and why?</h4>  \n\n<p>My favorite product is the Black and White Polka Dot Hair Scarf. I love this scarf because the <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=pebble+crepe\">pebble crepe</a> is such a beautiful fabric and the scarf is extremely versatile. Not only does the color go with everything but there are so many different ways to wear it. I like to tie mine around my ponytail and wear it as a headband.</p>  \n\n<p><img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/pebblecrepe_skus.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Pebble Crepe SKUs\" /></p>\n\n<p><i>Featured fabric: <a href=\"https://www.fabric.com/find?SearchText=pebble+crepe\">TELIO Pebble Crepe</a></i></p>  \n\n<h4>Why do you love working with Fabric.com? </h4>  \n\n<p>There are three main reasons I love working with Fabric.com:  \n<ul><li>Their selection is incredible! There are so many options when it comes to fibers, colors, and patterns.</li><li> I also love how reasonable the prices are. You can find beautiful high quality fabrics for a fraction of the cost of major retailers. </li><li>The last reason is that they offer free shipping on orders over a certain amount. As a small business owner who orders fabric regularly that is such a nice perk!</li></ul></p>  \n\n<h4>What is the most unexpected way you’ve worked with fabric?</h4>  \n\n<p>I recently had my first baby and I used some spandex fabric to make a pumping bra!</p>  \n\n<p><h4>What piece of advice do you wish you had before starting your business?</h4><p>In the past few months I have started listening to Jenna Kutcher’s Goal Digger Podcast. She talks a lot about having a mindset of abundance. That basically means believing that there is enough success, growth, and happiness for everyone. Just because someone else is successful doesn’t mean there is any less success for you.</p> <br />\n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/Product1.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Hair Accessories 1\" />\n<h4>How do you market your business? What has been the most impactful marketing tool you’ve used and why?</h4><p>I love to use social media to market my business. I also love to do local craft fairs and handmade markets because I get to meet my customers in person. I think that connecting with people face to face is the best way to market your business! </p> <br />\n<img src=\"https://fabric-webdata.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/Blog/Juniper%20Dress%20Co/product3.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Hair Accessories 2\" /></p>",
